Tim Maltin investigates the facts and the fiction surrounding the disaster. Did Captain Smith ignore reports that could have prevented the crash? Could a nearby ship have saved all the passengers? Did a mystery ship sail away, ignoring distress signals? Did the band really keep playing as the ship sank? Whether you think you know a lot or a little about this famous tragedy, you will find some surprises in this book.",

Although all of them are crazy about Tupac's  rap music, D is the one who truly understands where he’s coming from.

Before the action of the play begins, the chorus reveals that Antigone's father died without naming a successor. Antigone's brothers battle on opposite sides of the fight for the crown and kill each other. Creon, the man who takes the thone, declares the brother who fought for him to be a hero and the brother who fought against him to be a rebel. Antigone, though, still loves them both as brothers. She is dismayed when Creon denies her \"\"rebel\"\" brother a proper burial becuase without a burial, he is dishonored, picked apart by vultures, and barred from the afterlife of heroes. After the chorus finishes explaining the backstory, the play begins in the middle of the action, with Antigone declaring her defiance of Creon's orders and expressing her anger with her sister. Although written centuries ago, this play addresses issues related to love, loyalty, order, responsibility, inflexibility, and arrogance that are still relevant today. \n\n\nThis is an adapted version. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original play.",

The characters, too, are similart to people in Dickens’s life. David’s friendly landlord, Mr. Micawber, seems very close to what Dickens’s father was like, and, of course, Dora is a portrait of Dickens’s own first love. This novel is an insight into the life of one of America’s most popular authors. \n\nThis is an adapted story. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original story.",

Drinking the potion allows him to become, for a short time, a person free of conscience, who calls himself Mr. Edward Hyde. At first, these little vacations seem like harmless fun, but soon Dr. Jekyll finds them happening unintentionally, without the potion. Mr. Hyde is taking over. Stevenson uses the fictional doctor’s inability to control his experiment to suggest a theme about the responsible use of scientific knowledge.\n\nThis is an adapted story.

His inaugural address reflects some similarities with the speech of another president trying to communicate hope in a time of crisis... Abraham Lincoln. Obama called \"for a new age\" in much the same way that Lincoln spoke of \"a new birth\" in his speech at Gettysburg. Obama further echoed Lincoln by saying \"all are equal, all are free\" and that \"men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration.\"\n\nAlthough there are similarities between the two speeches, each speech is specific to its own time, place, and situation. In addition, quotations from speeches should not be read out of context. So read President Obama’s complete inauguration speech to fully appreciate his unique message as he began his historic administration as the first African American President of the United States.",

To protect them, she hides in a tiny attic space for seven long years. Harriet's story is horrifyingly, shockingly true.

His imagination was so powerful that he was able to determine a scientific explanation of gravity by just \"thinking on it.\"  Yet Newton was also small-minded. If other scientists  questioned his work, he resented them. Sometimes, he tried to ruin their careers. This books presents a compelling portrait of Newton as a genius full of contradictions. Author Kathleen Krull tells the story of how a man from seventeenth-century England lived and worked through plagues, the Great Fire of London, and two revolutions to become one of the most influential scientists in history.",

At least that’s what Lance Armstrong did.  He underwent grueling and aggressive treatments and surgery. He pushed himself physically to regain his strength and competitive edge.  Finally, on long bike rides through the mountains of North Carolina, he reawakened his passion for his sport and rededicated himself to appreciating the gift of life.",

All the while he is working behind Othello’s back to ruin his life. Why does Iago betray Othello? Is he jealous of Othello’s success, prejudiced against his color and culture, or envious of the passion he shares with Desdemona? The reasons behind Iago’s deceptions are never completely clear, but human nature provides a wealth of possible explanations. However, although Iago is clearly the villain in this drama, the other characters’ specific weaknesses, such as vanity, pride, distrust, and insecurity make it possible for Iago to manipulate them. Read the play to find out how Iago tricks the other characters into helping him accomplish his goal of destroying Othello.  \n\nThis is an adapted drama. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original play.",

They can't sing and they can barely play their instruments, but they have a following and they need a bass player. Pete can play circles around these amateurs, but there's a raw power to their sound that's surprisingly appealing. He can't resist, and he joins The Tiny Masters of Today. When the band gets a real chance at superstardom, Pete feels a twinge of doubt. He knows the quality of the music should come first... but who knew selling out could be so much fun?

Could there be a worse time for Scott's mother to announce that she's pregnant? Scott decides high school would be a lot less overwhelming if it came with a survival manual. He begins to write down tips for his soon-to-arrive brother or sister. Meanwhile, he's trying his best to capture the attention of Julia, the freshman goddess. In the process, Scott manages to become involved in nearly everything—from auditioning for the school play and running for student council to writing sports columns for the school paper.  This book is a record of the humorous and heartbreaking details of Scott's experiences as he tries to find his place in the confusing world of high school, win Julia's heart, and keep his sanity.",

Uncertain of whom or what it contains, the local people approach carrying a white flag to signal their peaceful intentions…and are blown away by a death ray. Clearly, these new arrivals do not come in peace.  They have superior technology, greater strength, and immense size. However, the humans have the will to live.  Is it enough? Can human civilization survive the war of the worlds?\n\nPublished in 1898, this science fiction classic is one of the first stories about aliens attacking Earth. It inspired movies, plays, and comic books. However, its biggest media hit was in 1938, when a Halloween night radio broadcast caused a nationwide panic because many listeners believed that the events they heard being dramatized were actually happening.",

After Tom agrees to tell his story in court, he becomes a target of the murderer's plan for revenge. Surrounded by danger and superstition, Tom and his friends struggle with important questions about responsibility, freedom, friendship, and their place in society.",

    "description": "In the late 1970s,  Argentina’s dictatorial regime silenced individuals who spoke out against the government by kidnapping and imprisoning them.  Author Gloria Whelan's historical novel takes its title from this real life horror. People who vanished in this way were called los desaparecidos, \"\"the disappeared.\"\" \n\nWith her hometown of Buenos Aires at the center of the political nightmare, Silvia devises a plan to save her missing brother: She’ll make Norberto, son of the general who arrests dissenters, fall in love with her.  Then, she'll convince him to have his father set Eduardo free.\n\nThis powerful and poetic story alternately follows Silvia as she spirals into Norberto’s world, and Eduardo as he struggles to endure physical and emotional torture. Will Silvia’s scheme reunite her family, or will the pursuit of freedom cost these devoted siblings their lives? Find out in this riveting tale about love and sacrifice by a National Book Award winner.",

For the ones who succeed, the million-dollar paychecks from Major League Baseball deliver them, and their families, from a life of grinding poverty. The successful few set an example that dazzles the neighbors they left behind. For the majority, though, the dream is an illusion. \n\nAuthor Mark Kurlansky reveals the connection between two countries' love affair with a sport. He tells the story of impoverished San Pedro and describes the remarkable journey of some of its baseball players, including Rico Carty, Albert Pujols, Robinson Canó, Sammy Sosa, and Alfonso Soriano.",

Two hundred years before Hepzibah Pyncheon was born, her ancestor Colonel Pyncheon had the seven-gabled-mansion she lives in built. Did he steal the land by having its owner Matthew Maule hanged for witchcraft? Maule must have thought so, because he died cursing the Colonel. Perhaps that curse is the reason Colonel Pyncheon was found dead in a chair in his brand-new mansion with his beard covered in blood. Some would, and do, say that curse has stayed with Hepzibah’s family ever since.\n\nThis is an adapted story.

He tells them that the monkey’s paw has the power to grant three wishes, but he also warns them to be careful. Morris says, “It had a spell put on it by...a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow.”  Of course, the White’s can’t resist making a wish, but why aren’t they happy when their wish comes true?",

Before this epic begins, war and captivity keep the hero Odysseus away from his family for twenty years. Now, he is finally free to go to them, but the sea god Poseidon dooms him to wander for ten more years.

It covers the key events of his metamorphosis from a misfit youngster growing up in poverty to an international star. It reports the details of his days as a starving backup musician in the early 1960s, his triumphant appearances at the Monterey Pop and Woodstock rock festivals, and his mysterious and sordid death in 1970. Key chapters provide vivid descriptions and critical evaluations of his albums and his songs.   Author Richie Unterberger also discusses Hendrix's many musical influences and his spectacular range of guitar techniques and effects. Special features focus on often overlooked aspects of Hendrix's art ranging from his love of Bob Dylan's music to his relationship with the Black Power movement, This biographical reference documents and analyzes all dimensions of this one-of-a-kind musical genius.",

It begins by assessing the impact of his rural, traditional childhood on his personality. Then, it describes his early years as a revolutionary leader and master strategist, including his private life and marriages. It explores his twenty-seven years in jail under apartheid, and reveals the inside stories of the white government's first secretive contacts with him. It also highlights Mandela's remarkable lack of bitterness and his commitment to reconciliation with the white minority after his release. Readers get a rare insight into Mandela's role both in the crucial negotiations period and during his term as South Africa's first black president. More than a biography, this guide critically examines Mandela's iconic status and his impact on the world stage.",

There, while leading his men on a mission to root out the hardcore hold-outs of Osama bin Laden’s forces, he confronts and kills an Al Qaeda fighter. On his return to the United States, he must face how the media has distorted public perception of the war as he seeks to make peace with the man he has become. Exum’s story of his introduction to the horrors of war is a frightening and inspiring first-hand account of combat from a new generation.",

    "description": "A poor young man named d’Artagnan has just arrived in Paris, desiring to become a member of King Louis XIII’s royal guard regiment, the Musketeers. His prospects don’t look too good. On his first day in town, he manages to be challenged to duel three separate Musketeers: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. As the duels are about to begin, a band of soldiers from a rival regiment happens by the field. When a scuffle breaks out, d’Artagnan chooses the side of his revered Musketeers.  He proves himself to be honorable, bold, and extremely handy with a sword. From that point on, he is included when the Muskateers call out, “All for one, and one for all!”\n\nThis is an adapted story. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original story.",

He set sail in 1834, eighty years before the Panama Canal was opened. His account of his adventures, published in 1840, became a best seller right away. In it, Dana describes in detail what life was truly like aboard the ship, from the danger and excitement of battling raging sea storms to the boredom of doing the same chores day after day.\n\nThis is an adapted account. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the account is very similar to the original diary.",

How did a teenage runaway become a renowned jazz singer? Long after her homeless days were behind her, Ella remained insecure. She often suffered from stage fright. Still, she was a born performer, able to improvise lyrics and record songs in single takes. She often seemed more comfortable on the stage than off, and even close friends found her hard to know.\n\nTanya Lee Stone’s biography of Ella Fitzgerald delivers several never-before-published details of this intensely private, legendary singer’s life.",

    "description": "There are countless stories and rumors related to comic book characters and the comic book industry. This book examines some of the more persistent ones and identifies which are true and which are false. For example, would you believe a Dutch inventor was refused a patent on a process because the process had already been used in a Donald Duck comic book? It’s true! It’s also true that Elvis Presley’s trademark hairstyle was based on a comic book character.\nBrian Cronin's book is more than just a list of fun facts about comic book history. Through the details of what people believe, or want to believe, about made-up characters, Cronin offers insights into real-world culture.  His book will entertain and inform not just comic book fans, but all seekers of \"truth, justice, and the American way.\"",

    "description": "This book is Emily Brontë’s only published novel. The title refers to an English countryside estate where the story takes place at the end of the eighteenth century. It was once the family home of Catherine Earnshaw and her brother Hindley. When they were children, their father brought home an orphaned boy named Heathcliff. Heathcliff and Catherine always loved each other, but Hindley hated Heathcliff. When Mr. Earnshaw died,  Hindley inherited the estate and began treating Heathcliff like a servant. When it was time for Catherine to marry, she chose social advancement over her love for the impoverished Heathcliffe. Hated by Hindley and rejected by Catherine, Heathcliff left his childhood home with bitterness in his heart. When he returns years later as a wealthy man, he brings the bitterness back with him, as well as the love he once felt for Catherine.  \n\nThis is an adapted story. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original story.",
