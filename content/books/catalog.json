Although Twain tells the tales of Tom's childhood in a humorous way, Tom's adventures have a serious side.  During a search for buried treasure, Tom and his friends witness a murder. After Tom agrees to tell his story in court, he becomes a target of the murderer's plan for revenge. Surrounded by danger and superstition, Tom and his friends struggle with important questions about responsibility, freedom, friendship, and their place in society.  This Pacemaker Classic is an adapted story. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original story.",

There have been countless books, TV shows, and movies about or based on Mr. Holmes and his loyal friend and assistant Dr. Watson. Watson narrates these stories about the super-genius detective Sherlock Holmes following clues, wearing disguises, and using logic to solve his cases. Through these short stories, Arthur Conan Doyle introduced his timeless detective character to the world.  This Pacemaker Classic is an adapted collection.

    "description": "Charles Dickens wrote over a dozen novels, but he called this one his favorite. Perhaps that’s because David is so very much like him. It’s widely known that this story of a young boy’s difficult path to manhood is highly autobiographical. Like Dickens, David is made to work long hours in a factory at an early age. The characters, too, are similar to people in Dickens’s life. David’s friendly landlord, Mr. Micawber, seems very close to what Dickens’s father was like, and, of course, Dora is a portrait of Dickens’s own first love. This novel is an insight into the life of one of America’s most popular authors.   This Pacemaker Classic is an adapted story. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original story.",

His prospects don’t look too good. On his first day in town, he manages to be challenged to duel three separate Musketeers: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. As the duels are about to begin, a band of soldiers from a rival regiment happens by the field. When a scuffle breaks out, d’Artagnan chooses the side of his revered Musketeers.  He proves himself to be honorable, bold, and extremely handy with a sword. From that point on, he is included when the Muskateers call out, “All for one, and one for all!”  This Pacemaker Classic is an adapted story.

One Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by three ghosts—the Ghost of Christmas Past, who lets Scrooge see how he once loved Christmas and how he started on the wrong path; the Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows him how other people will be enjoying the holiday; and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, who shows Scrooge that no one will care when he dies. Will Scrooge change his feelings toward Christmas and his fellow human beings, or will he continue to say, “Bah! Humbug!”?   This is an adapted story. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original story.",

His bravery and cunning are tested when he sets sail with Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey to track down the treasure horde. With its memorable characters and exciting plot of pirates, treachery, and heroism, this book holds a place as one of the greatest adventure stories.  This is an adapted story.
