The truth was he was kind of nervous about Henry&#x2019;s cousin moving to town. There was always the slight chance that Joss would interfere with his and Henry&#x2019;s time together, or worse, that he and Joss might not get along.</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;Sunday. Oh, and just so you know, don&#x2019;t count on seeing me much that day.

You should be grateful.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Both boys broke into hysterical laughter. Nelly chuckled and shook her head. &#x201c;All right, smart mouth. I&#x2019;m getting the mail. Henry, watch Vlad while I&#x2019;m gone. He&#x2019;s a trouble-maker.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad&#x2019;s jaw dropped in mock exasperation. &#x201c;Nelly!&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Nelly smiled sweetly. &#x201c;I mean, he&#x2019;s a wonderful boy who brightens my day and makes life worth living.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">After she slipped out the front door, Vlad eyed the wicked glimmer in Henry&#x2019;s eye suspiciously. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry&#x2019;s grin broadened. &#x201c;Did you call Meredith yet?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad straightened his shoulders proudly. &#x201c;Twice, actually.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry watched him for a moment, the surprise in his eyes quickly giving way to suspicion. &#x201c;You talked to her?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Talk to her? Vlad hadn&#x2019;t yet figured out a way to remove the lump that had taken up residence in his throat ever since she&#x2019;d leaned in for a kiss after the Freedom Fest dance and he&#x2019;d backed away, babbling like some kind of deranged lunatic. Talking to her was the least of his problems. First he needed to figure out how to breathe whenever she was near.</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad slowly stretched his hand out and picked up his mug, then took a long drink before returning it to the table. When he was finished, he met Henry&#x2019;s eyes and sighed. &#x201c;Nope. Hung up both times. I think she heard me breathing once though.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;That&#x2019;s progress.&#x201d; Henry sighed. &#x201c;You know she has caller ID, right?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad&#x2019;s eyes grew wide. There it was again, that lump in his throat. &#x201c;She does?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry answered with a tone of indifference. &#x201c;Yeah. But dude, check this out.&#x201d; He grinned wickedly and lowered his voice to a tone of conspiracy. &#x201c;Last night, Greg told me something interesting about the upperclassmen girls.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad leaned up against the counter and tried to act like he wasn&#x2019;t completely curious. &#x201c;Interesting? Like how?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry leaned closer. &#x201c;He says that if you can get invited to one of the senior parties, that some of those girls take pity on the lower classmen and they&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Aunt Nelly walked into the kitchen. In one hand was a stack of envelopes, in the other was a small brown box. She glanced at their frozen, startled expressions and raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;What are you boys talking about?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">They answered in one wavering voice, &#x201c;Nothing!&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad eyed the envelopes hopefully. &#x201c;Anything from Otis?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Nelly sighed and shook her head as she flipped through the stack. &#x201c;Honestly, Vladimir. Your uncle has written to you at least once a week since the day he left Bathory. Do you really think he&#x2019;d forget about you now?&#x201d; She pulled a thick parchment envelope from the pile and held it out to him with a smile.</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad sighed in relief. He&#x2019;d only just met his uncle last year, after a horrible misunderstanding. Vlad had no idea Otis was his uncle at the time, instead believing him to be a maniacal substitute teacher, out to expose Vlad&#x2019;s secret and quite possibly kill him. It was a simple mistake&#x2014;anyone could have made it. Instead, Otis had been protecting him from D&#x2019;Ablo, the president of an Elysian council, who was determined to find Vlad and punish him for the crime of existing.</div><div class=\"tx\">Apparently, vampires aren&#x2019;t really big on the idea of humans and vampires having kids together.</div><div class=\"tx\">Ever since Otis had left town in order to flee from Elysia and away from vampirekind, Vlad and Otis had exchanged many letters. In them, Otis had taught him how to read the vampiric language, otherwise known as Elysian code, and had urged him to practice his telepathy daily. Vlad was grateful for all of these things.</div><div class=\"tx\">Of course, Otis had also recently encouraged Vlad to work on controlling the minds of others. Vlad was intrigued&#x2014;there was no doubt about that. But there was one aspect that Otis hadn&#x2019;t thought about. What if Vlad got caught? The ability to control the thoughts and actions of other people could hardly be blamed on your normal, everyday teenage hormones.</div><div class=\"tx\">Still . . . it might make algebra easier to pass.</div><div class=\"tx\">But rather than explain his fear of being discovered, Vlad had written his uncle several weeks ago and insisted that he was incapable of controlling the minds of others, hoping that Otis would accept it as a lost cause and move on to some of the stealthier abilities of the undead. Like animorphing . . . or maybe luring females with a glance.</div><div class=\"tx\">He tore open the envelope and after squinting at Otis&#x2019;s crooked handwriting for a moment&#x2014;it always took him some time to adjust his eyes&#x2014;he read.</div><div class=\"atx\"><i>Dearest Vladimir</i>,</div><div class=\"atx\"><i>I hope this letter finds you well. To answer your  most recent questions: (1) No</i>,<i> there has been no further  word from Elysia concerning you or your father. However</i>,<i> you must remember that I am no longer privilegedto information concerning the legal procedures  of the Stokerton council. All of my information is hearsayand</i>,<i> therefore</i>,<i> not completely reliable. (2) Your  aunt is right to be so &#x201c;overprotective&#x201d; and insist that  you go nowhere alone. You may be a fearsome creatureof the night</i>,<i> Vladimir</i>,<i> but you are also a teenager  and</i>,<i> by definition</i>,<i> her ward. Besides</i>,<i> it is possible that  Elysia may decide to exact vengeance for your murder  of their president last year . . . despite the fact that it  was self-defense. (3) I&#x2019;m sorry</i>,<i> Vladimir</i>,<i> but the rumor </i> <i>that vampires are able to charm women with a leeringgaze is utterly ridiculous and completely false.  Have you tried simply asking Meredith if she likes  you? In my experience</i>,<i> the direct approach works best.  Calling a girl and breathing into the phone never got  anyone a date. Whatever you decide</i>,<i> remember to be  a gentleman.</i></div><div class=\"atx\"><i>As promised</i>,<i> I am enclosing further instructions on  how to best develop your telepathic skills. It surprises  me that you have had only minimal success with this  trait</i>,<i> as you should be able to read the minds of anyoneyou wish</i>,<i> but we must both remember that you  are the first of your kind</i>,<i> Vladimir</i>,<i> and things will  likely be different for you. When vampires are made</i>, <i>there is a natural order to their skill development</i>,<i> but  you . . . you were born</i>,<i> and as such</i>,<i> we cannot be certainwhich traits you will inherit from your father&#x2019;s  vampire nature</i>,<i> and which you will not</i>,<i> due to your  mother&#x2019;s human DNA. We must deal with each of  these skills as it presents itself.</i></div><div class=\"atx\"><i>Follow the enclosed instructions and practice</i>,<i> practice</i>, <i>practice! However</i>,<i> as your former teacher</i>,<i> I must insist  that you refrain from using your telepathy as a means  to better grades. And yes</i>,<i> I&#x2019;ll know. Trust me.</i></div><div class=\"atx\"><i>As for the issues you seem to be having with mind  control</i>,<i> give me time to compose some helpful tips </i> <i>regarding this skill. Together</i>,<i> we&#x2019;ll find a way to  make this possible. Your father was quite adept at doingthis. I confess that it surprises me that you may  not be. But please know that I am not disappointed in  the least.</i></div><div class=\"atx\"><i>You are always in my thoughts</i>,<i> Vlad. Please take  care of yourself. Be mindful of your surroundings</i>,<i> and  please continue to study Elysian code. I know the vampirelanguage is challenging to read</i>,<i> but it is important  that you memorize the </i>Compendium of Conscentia<i>.  According to the phrase coined by the notable humanphilosopher George Santayana</i>,<i> &#x201c;Those who cannotremember the past are condemned to repeat it.&#x201d;</i></div><div class=\"atx\"><i>Next week I will be in London&#x2014;the address where I  can be reached is enclosed. I will write as often as  I am able to. Please give my warm regards to Nelly.</i></div><div class=\"atx\"><i>Yours in Eternity</i>,</div><div class=\"atx\"><i>Otis</i></div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad ran his fingers over Otis&#x2019;s closing.<i> Yours in Eternity</i>. It was the same closing his dad had used in every note, every book, every birthday card, he&#x2019;d ever given to Vlad. Vlad felt the looming shadow of grief sweep over him again. The death of a loved one is funny like that. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how much you grieve or how much time has passed, the littlest reminder of the person who died&#x2014;a scent, an object, a word&#x2014;can send you back to the moment you lost them, and before you can blink, you&#x2019;re overcome by the aching sadness you worked so hard to leave behind.</div><div class=\"tx\">It was pretty disheartening to learn that dueling to the death last year against D&#x2019;Ablo might set vampire society on his heels, despite the fact that D&#x2019;Ablo had started the whole mess in the first place and Vlad had only blown a hole through him with the Lucis to avoid having D&#x2019;Ablo rip one through him with his bare hands. But Vlad could deal with that. After all, thanks to Otis, Elysia thought Vlad was human, not half-vampire. Of course, Otis had said that what with Vlad possessing the Lucis, the most dangerous weapon against vampirekind, Elysia was pretty anxious to agree that he was human, to deny the notion that he was even remotly capable of hurting them, giving them little reason to chase after Vlad.</div><div class=\"tx\">It was frustrating to learn that his uncle had absolutely no sensible advice regarding Vlad&#x2019;s current situation with the girl he liked. He thought about asking Nelly for her input, but the last thing he needed was a two-hour conversation about when Nelly was a teenager.</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad sighed. It was hopeless. How was he ever going to explain to Meredith that he had no idea why he hadn&#x2019;t kissed her after Freedom Fest dance last year, and that the only reason he hadn&#x2019;t returned her calls over the summer was that she would ask him to explain his inaction . . . and he couldn&#x2019;t. How was he supposed to explain something to her that even he didn&#x2019;t understand?</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; Henry peered over Vlad&#x2019;s shoulder at the parchment.</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad folded the letter and shoved it back in the envelope, then withdrew the instructions. &#x201c;He says to tell Nelly hi and that he&#x2019;s enclosed some tips on telepathy.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Nelly smiled warmly and blushed, then glanced at her watch and sighed. She shook her head and reached for her purse. On her way out the door, she called behind her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m late. I was supposed to take Deb&#x2019;s shift at the hospital this afternoon. Can you boys fend for dinner?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">The door closed before they could answer.</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry nodded toward Otis&#x2019;s instructions. &#x201c;You wanna try something out? I&#x2019;ve been dying to know if Melissa Hart likes me.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad folded the notes up and slipped them in his back jeans pocket. &#x201c;I want to study the notes first for a few days. Maybe we&#x2019;ll try something this weekend.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry groaned. &#x201c;Come on! I&#x2019;m busy this weekend. Joss, remember?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;I want to read them first.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;So read them. Then we can head over to the mall in Stokerton. Melissa is doing that &#x2018;end of summer/fall fashion&#x2019; show they do every year, and you&#x2014;&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;Henry, I said no.&#x201d; Vlad&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on Henry. His tone was stern.</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry nodded slowly and reached for his orange juice.</div><div class=\"tx\">Drudge or not, Vlad hated giving Henry direct orders, and he only did it if Henry was being too pushy about something Vlad didn&#x2019;t feel like doing or discussing . . . or if Vlad really wanted a Pepsi, but he really didn&#x2019;t feel like going into the kitchen to get one. Other than that, their vampire/vampire&#x2019;s-human-slave relationship was working out pretty well. It was astounding how well Henry had taken the news that with one bite, he&#x2019;d become Vlad&#x2019;s drudge.</div><div class=\"tx\">But then, maybe Henry had only taken it so well because Vlad had told him to.</div><div class=\"tx\">The thought made Vlad shiver. He didn&#x2019;t like the idea of controlling Henry&#x2019;s actions. Truthfully, it creeped him out a little. But sometimes Henry could be so pushy.</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad flipped over the box and, spying his name on the label, proceeded to pop the flaps open. His lips spread into a grin, and he looked at Henry. &#x201c;You wanna play<i> Race to  Armageddon 2</i>?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry gasped at the game box in Vlad&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;No way!&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad flipped the game over and looked at the screen shots. &#x201c;They say it&#x2019;s twice the action, three times the gore.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Exchanging maniacal grins, they bolted for the living room.</div><div class=\"tx\">Two hours, a bag of Doritos, seven Pepsis, and four bags of blood later, Vlad and Henry sat their controllers down and stretched. Henry&#x2019;s eyes were wide with awed disgust. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so gross. I love it!&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;No doubt. It&#x2019;s so cool that the androids can fly now.&#x201d; Vlad drained his Pepsi and sat the empty can on the coffee table. His stomach rumbled.</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry furrowed his brow. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the alien king having six heads? That&#x2019;s new. He&#x2019;s gonna be tough to beat this time.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;They really added a lot of blood. Speaking of which . . .&#x201d; Vlad retrieved another bag of blood from the refrigerator. As he was walking back into the living room, he let his fangs elongate&#x2014;his hunger was pulsing beneath them. He bit through the bag and drained it, then let out a burp and wiped the excess from the corners of his mouth.</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry chuckled. &#x201c;Pig.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad snickered. &#x201c; &#x2019;Scuse me.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry bit his lip thoughtfully for a moment. His tone became careful and serious. &#x201c;Do you think you&#x2019;ll ever start feeding on people?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad shook his head. &#x201c;No way. Not in a million years.&#x201d; He eyed Henry for a moment with his peripheral vision before facing him. &#x201c;You actually think I&#x2019;d do that?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">&#x201c;Well, you<i> did </i>bite me when we were eight.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad flashed Henry an incredulous look. &#x201c;Dude, we were <i>eight</i>. Besides, you told me to.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry pretended not to hear him. &#x201c;And just now, before you bit into that bag, your eyes changed that weird iridescent purple the way they do when you touch a glyph.&#x201d; Henry nodded to the strange symbol on the cover of the <i>Encyclopedia Vampyrica </i>and shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s possible. I mean, what if the bags and snack packs aren&#x2019;t enough anymore?&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Vlad shook his head and pressed his lips tightly together, tracing the glyphlike tattoo on the inside of his left wrist lightly. There was a long moment of silence before he spoke. &#x201c;If they were good enough for my dad to live on, they&#x2019;re good enough for me. Besides, the day I start feeding on people is the day I start beating you at video games.&#x201d;</div><div class=\"tx\">Henry laughed and picked up his controller. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;ll never happen.&#x201d;</div></body></html>",

Besides , it is possible that Elysia may decide to exact vengeance for your murder of their president last year . . . despite the fact that it was self-defense. (3) I&#x2019;m sorry , Vladimir , but the rumor that vampires are able to charm women with a leeringgaze is utterly ridiculous and completely false. Have you tried simply asking Meredith if she likes you? In my experience , the direct approach works best. Calling a girl and breathing into the phone never got anyone a date. Whatever you decide , remember to be a gentleman. As promised , I am enclosing further instructions on how to best develop your telepathic skills. It surprises me that you have had only minimal success with this trait , as you should be able to read the minds of anyoneyou wish , but we must both remember that you are the first of your kind , Vladimir , and things will likely be different for you. When vampires are made , there is a natural order to their skill development , but you . . . you were born , and as such , we cannot be certainwhich traits you will inherit from your father&#x2019;s vampire nature , and which you will not , due to your mother&#x2019;s human DNA. We must deal with each of these skills as it presents itself. Follow the enclosed instructions and practice , practice , practice! However , as your former teacher , I must insist that you refrain from using your telepathy as a means to better grades. And yes , I&#x2019;ll know. Trust me. As for the issues you seem to be having with mind control , give me time to compose some helpful tips regarding this skill. Together , we&#x2019;ll find a way to make this possible. Your father was quite adept at doingthis. I confess that it surprises me that you may not be. But please know that I am not disappointed in the least. You are always in my thoughts , Vlad. Please take care of yourself. Be mindful of your surroundings , and please continue to study Elysian code. I know the vampirelanguage is challenging to read , but it is important that you memorize the Compendium of Conscentia . According to the phrase coined by the notable humanphilosopher George Santayana , &#x201c;Those who cannotremember the past are condemned to repeat it.&#x201d; Next week I will be in London&#x2014;the address where I can be reached is enclosed. I will write as often as I am able to. Please give my warm regards to Nelly. Yours in Eternity , Otis Vlad ran his fingers over Otis&#x2019;s closing. Yours in Eternity . It was the same closing his dad had used in every note, every book, every birthday card, he&#x2019;d ever given to Vlad. Vlad felt the looming shadow of grief sweep over him again. The death of a loved one is funny like that. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how much you grieve or how much time has passed, the littlest reminder of the person who died&#x2014;a scent, an object, a word&#x2014;can send you back to the moment you lost them, and before you can blink, you&#x2019;re overcome by the aching sadness you worked so hard to leave behind. It was pretty disheartening to learn that dueling to the death last year against D&#x2019;Ablo might set vampire society on his heels, despite the fact that D&#x2019;Ablo had started the whole mess in the first place and Vlad had only blown a hole through him with the Lucis to avoid having D&#x2019;Ablo rip one through him with his bare hands. But Vlad could deal with that. After all, thanks to Otis, Elysia thought Vlad was human, not half-vampire. Of course, Otis had said that what with Vlad possessing the Lucis, the most dangerous weapon against vampirekind, Elysia was pretty anxious to agree that he was human, to deny the notion that he was even remotly capable of hurting them, giving them little reason to chase after Vlad. It was frustrating to learn that his uncle had absolutely no sensible advice regarding Vlad&#x2019;s current situation with the girl he liked. He thought about asking Nelly for her input, but the last thing he needed was a two-hour conversation about when Nelly was a teenager. Vlad sighed. It was hopeless. How was he ever going to explain to Meredith that he had no idea why he hadn&#x2019;t kissed her after Freedom Fest dance last year, and that the only reason he hadn&#x2019;t returned her calls over the summer was that she would ask him to explain his inaction . . . and he couldn&#x2019;t. How was he supposed to explain something to her that even he didn&#x2019;t understand? &#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; Henry peered over Vlad&#x2019;s shoulder at the parchment. Vlad folded the letter and shoved it back in the envelope, then withdrew the instructions. &#x201c;He says to tell Nelly hi and that he&#x2019;s enclosed some tips on telepathy.&#x201d; Nelly smiled warmly and blushed, then glanced at her watch and sighed. She shook her head and reached for her purse. On her way out the door, she called behind her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m late. I was supposed to take Deb&#x2019;s shift at the hospital this afternoon. Can you boys fend for dinner?&#x201d; The door closed before they could answer. Henry nodded toward Otis&#x2019;s instructions. &#x201c;You wanna try something out? I&#x2019;ve been dying to know if Melissa Hart likes me.&#x201d; Vlad folded the notes up and slipped them in his back jeans pocket. &#x201c;I want to study the notes first for a few days. Maybe we&#x2019;ll try something this weekend.&#x201d; Henry groaned. &#x201c;Come on! I&#x2019;m busy this weekend. Joss, remember?&#x201d; &#x201c;I want to read them first.&#x201d; &#x201c;So read them. Then we can head over to the mall in Stokerton. Melissa is doing that &#x2018;end of summer/fall fashion&#x2019; show they do every year, and you&#x2014;&#x201d; &#x201c;Henry, I said no.&#x201d; Vlad&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on Henry. His tone was stern. Henry nodded slowly and reached for his orange juice. Drudge or not, Vlad hated giving Henry direct orders, and he only did it if Henry was being too pushy about something Vlad didn&#x2019;t feel like doing or discussing . . . or if Vlad really wanted a Pepsi, but he really didn&#x2019;t feel like going into the kitchen to get one. Other than that, their vampire/vampire&#x2019;s-human-slave relationship was working out pretty well. It was astounding how well Henry had taken the news that with one bite, he&#x2019;d become Vlad&#x2019;s drudge. But then, maybe Henry had only taken it so well because Vlad had told him to. The thought made Vlad shiver. He didn&#x2019;t like the idea of controlling Henry&#x2019;s actions. Truthfully, it creeped him out a little. But sometimes Henry could be so pushy. Vlad flipped over the box and, spying his name on the label, proceeded to pop the flaps open. His lips spread into a grin, and he looked at Henry. &#x201c;You wanna play Race to Armageddon 2 ?&#x201d; Henry gasped at the game box in Vlad&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;No way!&#x201d; Vlad flipped the game over and looked at the screen shots. &#x201c;They say it&#x2019;s twice the action, three times the gore.&#x201d; Exchanging maniacal grins, they bolted for the living room. Two hours, a bag of Doritos, seven Pepsis, and four bags of blood later, Vlad and Henry sat their controllers down and stretched. Henry&#x2019;s eyes were wide with awed disgust. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so gross. I love it!&#x201d; &#x201c;No doubt. It&#x2019;s so cool that the androids can fly now.&#x201d; Vlad drained his Pepsi and sat the empty can on the coffee table. His stomach rumbled. Henry furrowed his brow. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the alien king having six heads? That&#x2019;s new. He&#x2019;s gonna be tough to beat this time.&#x201d; &#x201c;They really added a lot of blood. Speaking of which . . .&#x201d; Vlad retrieved another bag of blood from the refrigerator. As he was walking back into the living room, he let his fangs elongate&#x2014;his hunger was pulsing beneath them. He bit through the bag and drained it, then let out a burp and wiped the excess from the corners of his mouth. Henry chuckled. &#x201c;Pig.&#x201d; Vlad snickered. &#x201c; &#x2019;Scuse me.&#x201d; Henry bit his lip thoughtfully for a moment. His tone became careful and serious. &#x201c;Do you think you&#x2019;ll ever start feeding on people?&#x201d; Vlad shook his head. &#x201c;No way. Not in a million years.&#x201d; He eyed Henry for a moment with his peripheral vision before facing him. &#x201c;You actually think I&#x2019;d do that?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, you did bite me when we were eight.&#x201d; Vlad flashed Henry an incredulous look. &#x201c;Dude, we were eight . Besides, you told me to.&#x201d; Henry pretended not to hear him. &#x201c;And just now, before you bit into that bag, your eyes changed that weird iridescent purple the way they do when you touch a glyph.&#x201d; Henry nodded to the strange symbol on the cover of the Encyclopedia Vampyrica and shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s possible. I mean, what if the bags and snack packs aren&#x2019;t enough anymore?&#x201d; Vlad shook his head and pressed his lips tightly together, tracing the glyphlike tattoo on the inside of his left wrist lightly. There was a long moment of silence before he spoke. &#x201c;If they were good enough for my dad to live on, they&#x2019;re good enough for me. Besides, the day I start feeding on people is the day I start beating you at video games.&#x201d; Henry laughed and picked up his controller. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;ll never happen.&#x201d;"

All he could hope for was that Eddie would wake up tomorrow and realize that his eyes had played tricks on him on the spookiest night of the year. After all, it was pretty easy to get freaked out on Halloween, what with all the stories going around this time of year about werewolves, ghosts, and vampires. Vlad swallowed nervously. &#x201c;Well, well, well. Look what we have here, Tom.&#x201d; At Bill&#x2019;s first word, Vlad opened his eyes and sat up, but Bill shoved him back down on the bench with an open, heavy hand. Above him, quickly blocking his view of the moon, was Bill&#x2019;s bulbous head, grinning with an evil glint in his eye. Joining him after a second was a sinister-looking Tom. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna get it now, goth boy.&#x201d;"

He was crossing the street when he noticed a man standing on the corner, watching the house. Vlad&#x2019;s heart shot back into his body and grabbed onto his ribs for support. The slayer. Vlad bolted across the street, toward the house. In a blink, he had the Lucis out of his jeans pocket and his thumb poised over the end&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t sure what good it would do him against a human, but it was all he had."

Did you get much sleep?&#x201d; Like a dog to a whistle, a thin flight attendant with brown hair tapped Otis on the shoulder. Vlad rolled his eyes before she could say, &#x201c;Anything to drink, sir?&#x201d; He politely waved her away and turned back to Vlad, who shook his head. &#x201c;Why are we going to Siberia? Isn&#x2019;t it cold there?&#x201d;"

He could only nod occasionally and marvel at the company he was keeping. These vampires were nothing like those in Stokerton. They&#x2019;d welcomed him in like family. Vlad leaned closer to Otis. &#x201c;What is it that Vikas keeps calling me?&#x201d; Otis smiled. &#x201c;Mahlyenki Dyavol.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, but what does it mean?&#x201d;"

Vlad turned to his uncle with a surge of curiosity. &#x201c;Otis, if all a vampire has to do to create a drudge is bite them, why isn&#x2019;t the world overrun with drudges?&#x201d; Vikas and Otis exchanged glances before Otis spoke. &#x201c;Most humans do not survive our bites, Vladimir. We often kill to be kind, to end what would be a life of slavery for them before it has begun.&#x201d; Vikas&#x2019;s jaw grew tight. &#x201c;Do not gloss over the larger truth, my friend. Most vampires kill out of pleasure, not pity.&#x201d;"

When he was finished, he cast a nervous glance up at the door and then returned his gaze to the floor. When he spoke, it was so low that Vlad had to strain in order to discern words from the whisper of Eddie&#x2019;s breath. &#x201c;I always knew you were different. But I thought you were just an outcast, like me.&#x201d;"

They were in the third grade, and Meredith was the new kid. She stood in front of the class, all scared and timid, twisting the pink ribbon in her hair tightly around her fingertip. She&#x2019;d looked so frightened. All Vlad had wanted to do was to take her hand and protect her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, okay? I was way wrong. And now I feel like I&#x2019;ve screwed up our friendship and I feel terrible, Vlad.&#x201d; Joss met Vlad&#x2019;s gaze with honest eyes. &#x201c;Please. There&#x2019;s gotta be something I can do to make this up to you.&#x201d;"

And I&#x2019;ll keep slaying until the world is rid of those monsters.&#x201d;"

He moved to the elevator and pressed the up button. Lucky for him, the building was mostly empty. When the elevator came, he stepped inside. He touched his hand to a glyph in the wood, just as his uncle had done a year before, and the panel flipped open to reveal a second set of buttons. Vlad pressed thirteen and waited. When the doors opened, Vlad stepped out and looked around for Jasik. At the end of the hall two gloss black double doors stood open. Golden light poured from within. Vlad moved closer, sliding silently along the wall, and listened. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; A pause, then a small gasp. &#x201c;Excellent, Jasik.
