Like I say, Big Dog does not find big problems. Big problems find Big Dog! But he is home and OK, and I am happy. That is what I am thinking about, walking to the PE hall. But then I see Jake. Does Jake see me? Am I like Big Dog? Are problems going to find me? Oooooooo. I am like Big Dog. Jake sees me. And I am in the hall, waiting like a kid who likes problems! Think, Dan . Think! I back into the big school hall, and who do I back into but Tom! &#x201C;Sorry,&#x201D; I say. &#x201C;What is going on, my friend?&#x201D; Tom says, happy. Then he sees Jake. &#x201C;Jake, get off it,&#x201D; Tom says. &#x201C;Stop it with Dan! He&#x2019;s OK. You are the problem.&#x201D; Jake sees me, and he sees Tom. He wants to talk.

I think about it. I do not like it when people do not like me. I think, Can&#x2019;t we be friends? But Jake goes on into the PE hall, and I do not say what I am thinking. Kay walks by us. &#x201C;Dan? Tom? You OK?&#x201D; she says. Then I do not think about Jake. Kay&#x2019;s with me. I think about her, and I think about the game the next day. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re OK,&#x201D; I say. &#x201C;Can I walk you to PE?&#x201D; &#x201C;I like that,&#x201D; Kay says. &#x201C;I like that a lot.&#x201D; &#x201C;Hmmm. See you,&#x201D; Tom says and backs off. That is a friend. Backs you and backs off when you need him to. Kay and I walk to PE. &#x201C;I was thinking,&#x201D; Kay says, walking. &#x201C;Tom says Jake does not like you.&#x201D; &#x201C;That is Jake&#x2019;s problem,&#x201D; I say. &#x201C;But I do like you, and that is no problem.&#x201D; I do not want to talk about a kid like Jake with Kay. &#x201C;And I like you, Dan,&#x201D; says Kay, &#x201C;but think about it.
