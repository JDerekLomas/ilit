She taught him to believe he could become anything he wanted to be.\n\nFor his son's sake, Gardner decided not to stay in that subway station. He looked inside himself and found the power to move forward.\n\nBut Gardner's story can be anybody's story. The key is finding out what motivates you, or gets you moving. Love for his son got Gardner moving off that subway floor and into a new life. Once he got a job as a stockbroker and worked hard to succeed in that job, he found that he loved his work, too. Love was Gardner's motivation."
