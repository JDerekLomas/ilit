          "text": "Sofia found the map inside her grandmother's favorite book. It was folded into a tiny square, tucked between pages 112 and 113 of a Spanish novel called One Hundred Years of Solitude.\n\nThe paper was old and yellow. When Sofia unfolded it carefully, she saw lines drawn in green ink — rivers, mountains, and trees. In the center was a circle with a single word written inside it: Encontrada.\n\n\"Found,\" Sofia whispered. She knew enough Spanish to translate that.\n\nHer grandmother had been an archaeologist before she got sick. Abuela Elena had spent thirty years searching the Amazon rainforest for a city that most people said was just a legend. A city built by an ancient people who vanished five hundred years ago."
