          "text": "Mia hated the ocean. She hated the sound of waves. She hated the smell of salt. She hated the seagulls that screamed outside her new bedroom window at five in the morning.\n\nBut here she was, stuck in Tidepool Bay, population 2,300. Her mom had taken a job at the marine biology station. Her dad said it would be \"an adventure.\" Mia called it a disaster.\n\nTheir new house was small and blue, perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The wind never stopped blowing. Sand got into everything — her shoes, her cereal, her homework.\n\n\"Give it a chance,\" her mom said every morning. \"You might surprise yourself.\"\n\nMia doubted that very much."
