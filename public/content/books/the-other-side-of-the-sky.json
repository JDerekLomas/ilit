I’m not even nineteen years old, and I haven’t achieved anything yet. But Alyce said that with a life like mine, surviving itself is an achievement—just surviving.\n\nI don’t know if she’s right. When I look back at my childhood in Afghanistan, it seems so far away and long ago. Back then I thought I would grow up and grow old in the city of Kabul, surrounded by my big, complicated, loving family. Little did I know I would lose most of them before I turned fourteen.\n\nAs a child, gazing at the high walls around our home compound, I longed to see what lay on the other side of my city. I never dreamed that I would see our home reduced to rubble and would end up living on the other side of the world, in the suburbs of a city called Chicago.\n\nBut in the end, I have decided to tell this story because it is not mine alone. It is the story of many people. Probably, you have read the numbers. So many people have stepped on land mines, so many have gotten hurt by war, have lost their families, fled their homes. Each of us has a story. What happened to me—both the bad and the good—really does happen to people."

Looking back, I see that my life could have ended so many times, except for unexpected strangers who reached out to me in loving kindness. After I lost my leg, I thought I could never know happiness again, and yet that very loss opened the world to me in strange ways and showed me wonders that I had never imagined.\n\nI have seen my dreams crushed, but new ones have sprouted in their place, and some of those dreams have even come true. I have lost loved ones but not love itself. That’s what my story is about, I think. That’s the story I want to share with you now, the story of my life, so far."

I don’t like to think about it either, but on that score I don’t always get to choose. One time last summer my new American friends, Alyce and John, took me to a carnival here in the suburbs of Chicago, where I live now with my mother. What a dazzling sight it was for a seventeen-year-old girl who had lived most of her life in Afghanistan and in the refugee camps of Pakistan. I had never seen anything like it—the colors, lights, noise, and spectacle. I ate cotton candy and tried my luck at a few sideshow games, and then we went to look at the rides.\n\nWe came to one called the Gondola. It was shaped like a large boat suspended from two long poles. It had many rows of seats, all facing the center. The boat was swinging back and forth when we arrived. Each time it swung in one direction, the seats on that side lifted way up, maybe a hundred feet into the air. Then it swung the other way, and the seats on the other side lifted up. It was kind of like a massive swing that went from side to side instead of forward and backward."

That was what they enjoyed about the ride.\n\nI told Alyce I wanted to try it. Alyce wasn’t so sure about that, but I insisted I could handle it. So she bought some tickets, and we both climbed aboard. We went to the very end of the boat, to the seats that rose the very highest, because we wanted the full effect, the biggest scare—the most fun. The man came through and locked down a bar in front of us. That bar keeps you from falling out when the ride is going. Of course, you can still get out by climbing over the bar, but when the Gondola is swinging back and forth at full speed, who would want to?\n\nAt first the ship swung slowly. It didn’t go very far in either direction. But gradually, the boat went faster and swung farther. Each swing took our seats higher, and when the boat reached the top of its swing, it seemed to pause. For an instant I felt weightless. Then, when it swung the other way, I felt as if I was falling fast. My heart came into my throat, and my throat dropped down into my stomach. It was scary but exhilarating, and I was loving that feeling of speed and of the wind in my hair."

And when that spark flashed in my eyes, it triggered something. I dropped through a trapdoor into some other reality. Suddenly, I wasn’t in America on a carnival ride. I was on the ground, looking up into the sky and the sun. I had fallen out of that day and into a moment ten years in the past. Above me what I saw was that ring of faces, the people who had gathered around to gawk at me after the land mine went off—it was as real to me as the clouds overhead.\n\nSo I started screaming, right there on the Gondola ride, just like I did on that terrible day. “Why don’t you help me? Why are you all just looking at me like that? Help me, someone help me!”"

I scrambled to get away from the horror of what had happened—except that I was not really on the ground in Afghanistan. I was at a carnival in Wheaton, Illinois, on the Gondola, struggling to get out of my seat on a ride that was going a hundred miles an hour, back and forth, up and down. Thank God Alyce was there by my side, as she has been by my side so often in these last few years. Thank God she knew at once what I was about to do, and she flung her arms around me and kept me in my place and shook me and called into my ear, “Wake up, Farah! Wake up!”\n\nI came back to consciousness. The ride was still going, and I knew vaguely where I was, but only through the fog of a terror that I couldn’t blink away. I yelled, “Stop the ride, stop the ride!”\n\nBut of course they didn’t stop the ride. They never stop the ride."

If I had managed to jump from the Gondola ride at the peak of its motion, yes, I would have made the news: ONE-LEGGED AFGHAN GIRL JUMPS FROM CARNIVAL RIDE. But it didn’t happen because Alyce was there to save my life—but then, Alyce has done that in a lot of ways, big and small, since we met two years ago.\n\nThe ride finally slowed down, and the world around me changed from a blur of motion to a field of happy crowds enjoying a summer day. I said, “Oh my goodness, what happened?” I looked around and said, “Oh my goodness! I’m not in Afghanistan. It’s not that day. I’m in America.” Nothing was broken, I was told. The machine was supposed to make sparks.\n\nEven now, I wonder what triggered my flashback at that carnival. Was it the heart-swelling sensation of falling? Was it the light that flashed in my eyes and then morphed into the sunlight of that awful day, the sunlight that shone through that ring of horrified faces? I wish I knew so I could get ready for the next time or avoid tripping another switch that turns some ordinary moment into a horrible waking dream."

It’s not like those first few weeks or even months after it was amputated, when I used to dream that I was riding a bicycle or running around in our yard in Kabul or just walking.\n\nIn those dreams I would say, Oh my gosh, look at this! I can ride a bicycle, I’m running. What was I worrying about? My leg is just fine! I don’t have those kinds of dreams anymore. Now when I take off my prosthetic leg at night, I feel like I have always been this way. Although my mind remembers another time. They say that amputees can feel their missing limbs, but I never have. I don’t feel pain, absence, presence, or any other sensation where my leg used to be. My body knows it’s gone. It’s just my mind that sometimes forgets. The other night I woke up thirsty and wanted a glass of water, so I automatically started to get out of bed. I almost fell, and then I remembered that I had to put on my prosthesis.\n\nMy mother and I are safe now, living in Carol Stream, Illinois. We have good food and decent shelter, and I have a dear friend. I should be contented now. I should be happy every day, every minute, every instant. It troubles me that I’m discontent and sad so much of the time."

When they said, “Dinner is ready”, we rushed the tablecloth, hands unwashed. They sent us back. “Wash your hands, children!” And then we’d all be scrambling and jostling around the water pot, splashing one another and giggling, I remember the excitement of dinnertime. Five of us siblings clustered around one platter, banging elbows, chattering and gobbling. My father would tell us sternly, “It’s time to eat, not talk!” And then if we were hungry, we’d worry that the others would eat up all the food before we got our portion, because we were sharing from a single platter. So we’d all settle down to win the competition, each of us cramming the food away by the fistful as fast as we could. Crowding and gobbling—it was so much fun to be one of five children eating together from a single platter. How we laughed! The taste of the food that I ate eleven or twelve years ago remains in my mouth more vividly than the food I eat today, because that’s actually the memory of a kind of fun I can never have again: I’m remembering the flavor of being with my family, part of one big, loving group. We aren’t that big group anymore. It’s down to just the two of us now—my mother and me."

A thousand years ago Ghazni was the capital of an empire that stretched from the Indus River to the Caspian Sea. It was a city brimming with artists and poets and scholars. It had paved streets and magnificent buildings—mosques and palaces and towers, covered with mosaic tiles in shimmering designs that looked like lace.\n\nToday Ghazni is a small walled city of about forty thousand. The ruins of two tall towers and a few fragments of ancient walls are all that remain of Ghazni’s glorious past. On those towers you can still see some of the tile work, but today’s Ghazni is mainly a market town that serves as a gateway to Hazarajat, the valley in central Afghanistan where the Hazara people—my people—mostly live.\n\nLike most rural Afghans, the people of our village made their living as farmers. They raised animals, too—cows, buffalo, goats, sheep, and chickens. We lived in fortresslike compounds called qalas, scattered up and down the valley My father’s father was a mullah, a learned man who read the Koran and knew the commandments of our faith. A mullah takes care of the mosque and leads prayers on Fridays and religious holidays. He teaches youngsters to read and write and administers the rituals that mark the important stages of ordinary life."

And each morning, just before dawn, it was my grandfather who climbed up into the tower of the mosque and sounded the aazan, the call to prayer.\n\nMy grandfather achieved his respected position when he was still a young man. As I mentioned, his duties included teaching children, teenagers, and even some adults (if they wanted) to read and write. He taught both girls and boys, but he taught them separately.\n\nAs a young man, my grandfather was engaged to be married to his cousin. A mullah is allowed to marry, just like any other man. He also may own land, grow crops, conduct business, and do anything else that ordinary people do. There is nothing special about him except for his learning. My grandfather’s parents had arranged the match with his cousin long before either party was of age. This was very common in Afghanistan, for most marriages are arranged by families there."

A proper, modest Muslim woman is supposed to keep her hair covered, but this girl’s scarf covered more than her hair. It covered her whole forehead right down over her eyebrows, which is not considered necessary. My grandfather somehow got it into his head that this girl wore such a head scarf because she was bald. He began to think about this possibility day and night: Was she bald or wasn’t she? It became his obsession. One day he finally couldn’t take it any longer. He had to know.\n\nThat day, when the girl got up from her lesson to leave the room, the end of her long head scarf was trailing on the ground. My grandfather (accidentally-on-purpose) stepped on that bit of scarf. As the girl stood up, therefore, the scarf was pulled off her head, and my grandfather saw that not only did she have a full head of hair, but she was beautiful. He fell in love with her on the spot.\n\nHe went to his parents and said, “Forget about that match with my cousin. I want to marry someone else.” And he told them about his beautiful student."

Eventually, the arguments died down, however, and my grandfather won his parents over. The ancient engagement was broken off, and the elders did the necessary negotiating with the parents of my grandfather’s beautiful student. This is how my grandparents on my father’s side got together.\n\nThey had a big family, three girls and four boys. My grandfather owned some land, but he could not farm it properly because his duties as a mullah kept him too busy. As a result, in spite of all the respect he gained for his religious position, his material circumstances declined. He was forced to borrow large sums of money on several occasions.\n\nIn Islam it is illegal to charge interest for a loan. So, when people borrow money, they give the lender some form of valuable moneymaking collateral. The lender holds that property and makes use of it as if it were his own until he gets his money back. Essentially, you might say that in order to borrow money, you have to pawn something of value. My grandfather was forced to pawn his lands. Without land, he had no way to make money, so he could not get his lands out of hock. For all intents and purposes, once he borrowed money, my grandfather became a landless peasant."

After several years my father was able to return to our village with cash in his pocket. He paid off his fathers debts, got the family lands back, and restored my family to landowner status.

Their arrival caused a great hubbub in the malik’s household. “The mother of Ghulam Hussein has come to see us,” people said. “The mother of that famous hero has come. What can she want?”"

In fact, she stayed out of sight in the back rooms as much as she could, having assumed that the visitors had come to discuss some sort of solemn business, possibly related to land. She never thought their visit had anything to do with her. That’s my mother’s modesty.\n\nBut when she came into the room to serve some food to the guests, my grandmother said to her, “Fatima-jan! Come over here and help me out. I seem to have a splinter in my finger.” She said this just to draw the girl close so she could get a good look at her and see if she was really as beautiful as she seemed from a distance. My mother came over and dutifully began to look for the splinter in her future mother-in-law’s finger. Suddenly, she felt the intensity of my grandmother’s gaze. Looking up, she realized in a flash that this woman had come looking for a bride. Embarrassment and panic swept over her, and she ran away—but my grandmother had seen all that she needed to see. This girl would do."

They didn’t say, Oh, we can’t, she’s too young, this is so unexpected, come back another day, we have to get over the tizzy you have put us in. They were all too happy to say yes to a match between their daughter and the famous hero Ghulam Hussein, the boy who had saved his fathers land. Besides, the son of a mullah marrying the daughter of a malik—this looked like a fitting match to both families and to all the relatives on either side. The agreement was quickly made, therefore, and my parents got engaged."

But inside, of course, she was dying of curiosity. Finally, she did turn her head stealthily to steal just a peep, if she could, of her husband-to-be. Unfortunately, my father was sitting a little too far back for her to see him. A lamp behind him cast his shadow on the floor. Because the light was so close to him, his shadow looked huge. That shadow was my mother’s first impression of my father. She thought her parents had betrothed her to an enormous fat man, and she panicked. Later, when she found that he was of normal size and such a pleasant fellow, and so good-looking to boot, she was relieved and delighted."

When they arrived at the groom’s village, they took my mother into the wedding chamber, and there the women swarmed around and fussed over her. They fixed her hair and put the beauty dots on her cheeks, and then they wrapped her in a big scarf, because she certainly wasn’t going to show her face to just anyone. Not only did she wear that scarf over her head, but she kept a big white handkerchief in front of her face throughout the wedding. Technically, my father was supposed to see her for the first time at the wedding, but actually, they had gotten to know each other quite well during their two-year engagement period. Still, they went through the ritual in which a blanket is thrown over the couple so they can look at each other’s faces in a mirror, supposedly for the first time. This is how things were done in an Afghan village just thirty or forty years ago, when my parents got married; it’s how things are still done in much of Afghanistan today."

Everywhere else in the valley, people were still talking about my father’s achievements in Kabul and marveling over the money he had made and how he had gotten his own father out of debt. The head of our village got jealous of our family. He said my father was putting on airs and behaving as if he thought he was better than other people.\n\nFinally, my father couldn’t stand it anymore. He said to his parents, “Come on, let’s move to the city”. So in 1976 my father and his parents and siblings all moved to Kabul. They rented a small compound in the southwestern section of the city, and my father began supporting the family as a tailor.\n\nAfghanistan was going through great changes at the time. Kabul was becoming a modern city. My mother used to tell me how it was in the capital when she first moved there, and later, too, when the Russians occupied the city. In those days, she said, city women went to work outside the home. They wore stockings instead of the traditional baggy pantaloons. They didn’t wear veils or even head scarves. They appeared on TV, where they read the news, sang songs, and even performed dances."

Even in the city, people had different attitudes about the changes. I guess some people can handle drastic change and embrace it, and others can’t. Some people want change; some don’t.\n\nIn those days my father made a Western-style outfit for my mother. He told her, “Don’t wear a head scarf anymore. Cut your hair, be modern.” But my mother was a traditional woman, and on this point she refused to go along with her husband’s wishes. “I won’t do it,” she said. “I don’t want to be a ‘modern’ woman.”\n\nMeanwhile, politics were heating up in our country. Three years before my parents moved to Kabul, the last king of Afghanistan had been overthrown by his own cousin, Sardar Daoud, who quickly began ruling the country as a military dictator. Daoud called himself a “president,” but he was a member of the same royal dynasty that had ruled Afghanistan for almost two hundred years."

These Afghan Communists had nothing to do with royalty or Afghan aristocracy. For the first time in my country’s history a political party, rather than a family, held power, and the leaders of this party were people without prestigious connections or famous family names.\n\nAt first these changes at the top did not affect our family much. My family members had nothing to do with politics, as they were actually practiced, and none of them held any government positions. Violence broke out sporadically in the city among competing factions of Communists, but when gun battles or political murders took place in some other neighborhood, my parents usually did not even hear about it until later, and then just as stories. Ordinary people did not really feel threatened in everyday life, especially not in their own neighborhoods.\n\nMy father was gaining a reputation as a tailor, and his business was growing—this was the big news for the family. My father was making good money, and my mother was working side by side with him, managing that money. Each week my father gave her a certain amount of cash to cover family expenses, and she allocated the money to various uses, hunting up the best bargains and tracking every coin spent. She was so good at money management that she saved about half of what he gave her each week."

My mother told everyone that her husband had bought all that gold for her. She didn’t mention the part she played with her money-management skills. In short, she gave all the credit to my father, in order to elevate his reputation. He appreciated what she did for him. My parents had a good marriage.\n\nThen, at the end of 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. At first even this made no real difference to ordinary people like my father. He went on plying his trade. The Soviet troops secured Kabul against looters and thugs, murderers and rebels. On an everyday level, in what was soon to be my neighborhood, life went on more or less peacefully.

They were out to defeat rebels called mujahideen, who were rallying the rural people against Soviet rule. These rebels were emerging all over the country, in all the villages. When the government dropped bombs to get rid of the rebels, it also drove many villagers from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of families streamed south or west, trying to get out of the country, hoping to find safety in Pakistan or Iran.\n\nFor most Afghans, however, the nearest border lay far away, across a dangerous landscape, a journey of many days, and those who fled the country forfeited everything they owned. Leaving the country was therefore a big decision that not everyone was willing to embrace. Millions fled, but millions more stayed. Many of the latter still had to leave their bombed-out villages, though. They made their way to the nearest place where bombs were not falling. And the single safest place from Soviet bombardment was Kabul, because that is where the Soviets themselves lived. In just a few years, therefore, that pleasant city filled up with refugees from the villages and swelled into a bloated metropolis full of sprawling slums."

My father was supporting his siblings as well as his parents. He paid for his brothers’ weddings, which is no small thing, because in Afghanistan the groom is responsible for all wedding costs and he must pay a dowry as well. The cost of marriage keeps many poor men single their whole lives. Thanks to my father, however, my uncles escaped this fate. With my grandmother’s help, my father also found husbands for his sisters.\n\nThe family compound in southwest Kabul was not a tiny place, but it could not compare to those fortress-compounds in the villages.

My uncles accused my father of treating his own family as if they were strangers. It was all part of the conflict between an old way of life and a new way of life. My father leaned toward modern ways. He wanted to be part of a new, socially modern Afghanistan, and this included the idea of nuclear families living in separate households. He and his brothers fell out over these issues. Finally, his brothers moved out in a huff. The truth is, their wives were pressing them as well.

She consulted mullahs; they told her to pray. She prayed and wept and prayed some more. She visited the shrines of saints and bought amulets. Nothing worked. During the course of all this my mother developed a little cough—the first sign of a problem that would virtually cripple her in later life.

In Afghanistan our classrooms were naked chambers with nothing on the walls except a chalkboard.\n\nMy class had about thirty kids, half of them boys and half of them girls. The boys all sat on one side of the room, the girls on the other. We sat on benches arranged in rows, four of us to a bench. The school did not have enough benches for all the students, so we jostled and struggled for places every day. Those who failed to get a seat on a bench had to sit on the floor."

But the next day students from those other classrooms would come early and take their benches back. And on the next day after that students from both classrooms might come early and fight over benches. Every morning before school started, you got this scuffling and struggling over benches. It was all in good fun, though. No one got hurt. We were playing.\n\nSchool was casual in Afghanistan, not like in America, where children go to school in the morning and don’t get home till four o’clock. Maybe by the time you got to sixth or seventh grade in Afghanistan, you went to school that long—I don’t know. As a kid, I didn’t know what the older grades did. Our school only went to fifth grade. Anyone who got further than that had to go to another bigger school farther away. I knew only that we little kids started at eight and headed home around ten thirty a.m."

The boys played running games, hitting games, wrestling games, throwing games, and other rambunctious sports. We girls used to play a twirling game called bobo-jan, which means “mommy-dear”. Two girls would hold hands and spin around and around until they got dizzy and then let go and try to walk. Why was it called “mommy-dear”? I have no idea. Sometimes we played other active games, like hide-and-seek, but never with the boys. I don’t remember girls and boys ever playing together in my school.\n\nMostly, we girls sat in the sun at recess and told stories and ate our bread. We all brought big flat loaves of freshly baked bread to school. That bread had such a flavor at recess, because we were hungry. Actually, it was good anytime. The American bread I have eaten is generally made from refined flour, and it has an airy texture. Back home we made rich, chewy bread out of whole grain. I loved hot bread, fresh from the naan-bayee. I preferred that bread to meat, to kebabs, to anything. It tasted that good. Anyway, that’s what all of us ate at recess."

The Communist government of Afghanistan fell from power, and mujahideen took over the city. The mujahideen were the rebels who had been fighting for twelve long years against the Soviets and then against the Communist Afghan government, which the Soviets left in power after they withdrew from the country in 1989. The mujahideen, however, were made up of many groups, and once they took over the city, they began to fight with one another. One group took control of a mountaintop in Kabul and, from there, fired down at its enemies in the various surrounding neighborhoods. Another group made its headquarters outside the city and launched rockets at night. Most of these rockets landed in other neighborhoods. We heard them, but we didn’t worry about them too much. It was just part of life. Some days, however, were “bad rocket days,” and then the schools would be closed. Or sometimes, during the day, we started to hear too many rockets, or the rockets sounded like they were coming closer and closer. On such occasions the teachers would say, “Go home, children. We’ll pick this up again when things get calm.” In short, school was sporadic—open some days, shut on others."

There we were at our own school again, struggling over benches and then later assembling in rows to listen to our teacher. I loved school in part because I got to play with so many other children my own age, children whom I saw only at school, because they were not related to me. That’s how it was in Afghanistan, at least for children: You spent most of your time with your family and your relatives."

In second grade we began to learn about the world. We had no books, just a teacher, but she was a wonderful woman. She wore a long colorful dress with a small hand-embroidered head scarf. Outside the school grounds, she replaced this with a bigger white scarf known as a chadar-namaz, a “prayer scarf.” She was slender and very tall, and we children took great pride in her height.

She told us too that there were other countries in the world, quite different from ours. The idea of other countries, other people different from us, wearing different kinds of clothes, living in different kinds of houses, speaking different languages—this dazzled me and filled my mind with possibilities. I received her words like a desert receiving rain, just drank them in, drank up her stories.\n\nAt home I had often wondered what the sky was like. I pictured getting a long, long ladder and climbing up to the sky and feeling it. What would it feel like? I wondered. Would it be soft, hard, shiny, smooth, or what? And what if you could break through the shell of the sky? I mused. What if you could poke your head through the hole you broke—what would you see?\n\nWhat was on the other side of the sky?"

She said the stars, which seem so small, are actually bigger than Earth itself. They only look small because they’re so far away. Wow! After that I would often go out at night and stare up at the sky. I would think, Okay, then. Let’s see. If those twinkles are bigger than Earth, how very far away they must be to look so small! What a universe this must be, to contain such distances. And what if you could travel to those stars and look from there, beyond, beyond—what would you see then? Just how far did the universe go?

By the time they got me into the German hospital, I was more or less awake.\n\nIt was night, and everything was very quiet. I was awake enough to see that this hospital was so clean, so still, so beautiful! My heart opened at the sight of it, opened wide. A feeling of relief, of luxury, even of gladness wove in there with the pain and confusion."

I got alarmed. Who were these people? They were taking pictures of me too, and some of them were sticking needles into me and taking blood. Others were poking at different parts of my body and examining me here and there. I had tubes stuck into me all over. They did all this while I was lying in that bed—they didn’t stir me at all. Then sleep closed over me again, and the next time I woke up, they were gone and I was alone."

I was awake by then and knew what was about to happen. My very bones tensed up as they moved me onto a gurney. But instead of tearing the bandages away, as the nurses in Kabul used to do, they set me in a tub of warm liquid mixed with some sort of brown medicine—iodine, I now realize. After the bandages were completely soaked and softened, they gave me some skin-thin rubber gloves to slip on. Then they gestured to me to take the bandages off myself. They knew that I could get them off better than anyone else, because no other person could possibly be as sensitive to my pain as I was. I understood their reasoning without understanding their words. They were so smart, those German doctors! I wondered why the Afghan doctors hadn’t ever thought of this technique. I spent a long, long time in that warm liquid, peeling the bandages off myself, layer by layer, or at times just thread by thread. I didn’t want to look at my flesh as I uncovered it, but I felt so grateful to the doctors for letting me do it this way. Their compassion made my heart let go and made me surrender myself to Allah."

Slowly, I discovered in myself a capacity for traces of pleasure because these medical people showed such lovingness to me and nursed me so graciously and brought me toys.\n\nI have to say that the doctors in Afghanistan had a certain arrogance to them as a group. They acted like they were of a higher station than their patients. And the nurses? Even worse! You couldn’t even talk to them—their station was so high above yours, they took any plea for attention as an insult. Once, when I cried and tried to turn away from an injection, the nurse just stalked away in a huff. “If you’re going to fuss about this, you can stew in your infection,” she said.\n\nMy mother ran after her pleading, “No, no, no, please don’t be mad at my little girl.

Going from the hospital in Afghanistan to this one felt like going from hell to heaven.\n\nStill, I kept slipping in and out of consciousness in those early months, and every second or third time that I woke up, I found my room crowded with strangers in white uniforms jabbering at one another over my body.\n\nAs it turns out, the bone of my right leg had eroded. Dirt and blood had gotten in there. That’s what they were talking about. After studying the situation, the doctors decided they had to remove the parts of my leg bone that had gotten infected. Otherwise, the infection would have spread to the rest of my leg and then to the rest of my body. In fact, the infection had already reached a critical stage, and there was no time to spare."

Maybe they would have high heels for me, ready to wear. I wanted them to be red. Or would black be better? And what kind of shoes?

My heart was thrilling away to those stories. For me, when I saw the emptiness below my knee, the land mine exploded a second time. Oh my gosh, this is Germany, I was thinking. It’s a good hospital, these are good doctors—why did they do this to me?\n\nIt was then that I started to weep, all by myself in that hospital room. Quietly, though. And no tears came out. I had cried them all. I just sobbed and sobbed with eyes as dry as dust. And I kept thinking, This is Germany! They’re supposed to know how to fix a person’s legs here. Why did they do this to me?

Here a glad shout rose up, there a jovial clamor. With each outburst, one child from our group, and then another, and another let out a happy responding shout of recognition and went running or stumbling to his or her family. Steadily, the children melted away until only two were left, me and another girl. I thought, Something happened to my family while I was gone. The other girl must have been thinking a similar thought. We both stood there, our faces growing longer and longer as apprehension tightened its grip on our hearts.\n\nBut then—wait—who was that? Two taxis had pulled into the parking lot. My father and mother got out of one. My aunt, my sisters, and my brothers came out of the other. All of them had armfuls of flowers. I let out my own cry of joy and soon found myself swirled into the embrace of my family. So many had come to welcome me that there was scarcely room in the taxi. I was stuffed in among them like cotton into a pillow. I forgot to say good-bye to that one other girl who was with me. I forgot to look back to see if someone had come for her. I just hope her family came soon."

They began to fill my ears with family news. My aunt, for instance, had borne another child since I left, a boy, God be praised; but he was too young to come to the airport. One of the cousins was staying home with him. But all this chatter felt like pellets bouncing off me. I felt separated from this life. My head was still in Germany, and I only wanted to tell my family about that gleaming world, but I didn’t know how to begin.\n\nBesides, I was already discovering something disturbing. I didn’t speak Farsi very well anymore. I understood everything people said, but when I tried to express myself, my tongue felt clumsy and I often forgot some crucial word, and then I got stuck and couldn’t finish my sentence. How could I sink into the luxury of being with my family again if I could not even talk to them?\n\nMeanwhile, on our way through Kabul as I gazed out the windows, I saw one damaged neighborhood after another—walls broken down, buildings with shattered roofs, structures with missing windows, houses that looked deserted."

I was looking at my family’s hard-won home with German eyes. I stumbled through the gate, into the yard, and stared around me at the mud-brick buildings. How small and squalid the whole space looked, and how enclosed! Instead of making me feel safe—as they used to, as they still made my mother and no doubt my sisters feel—these high walls made me feel imprisoned. I felt as if I could not draw a proper breath in this compound. At once I began longing for space, for absence of enclosure, for freedom.\n\nWe went inside the house. My mother brought out a box and opened it to show me a single thick braid of my own hair. As a little girl, I used to have long hair, but they cut it off at the hospital. My mother saved that hair, however. After I went to Germany, she looked at my braid whenever she missed me. The box had a worn look from being opened and closed so many times. My mother also showed me the grease spot in the bedding, where I had hidden that stolen cookie, another souvenir she had treasured throughout these two years. We all laughed about that stolen cookie, and we cried about it too, without quite understanding the meaning of our tears."

But to me, after being in Germany, these rooms seemed garish and cheap. Our home embarrassed me. I wanted the subdued pastels of Germany.\n\nAnd the designs! In Germany the interior design had been simple and quiet—and that is what I still prefer. Even now, here in America, I would decorate simply if it were up to me, but my mother likes floral patterns and bright colors. For her sake, we have glaringly colorful carpets and the brightest, busiest furniture we have been able to find. That’s how our home in Kabul looked too. We were sitting on bright red mattress pads around bright red Afghan rugs woven in the usual intricate Turkoman patterns.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the colors and patterns that shocked my senses. We were sitting on the floor! We didn’t have couches or armchairs. We had no tables. And soon my sisters brought out a long white cloth and spread it out—on the floor.

Days passed, but the rockets kept falling. Finally, my uncle said, “Well, it’s dangerous to step out of the house, but I have two wives now and all these children. If I don’t go out and get some bread, my whole family will starve.” So he made his way to the big Russian-built bread factory known as Seeloh. He was waiting at the bus stop with his arms full of bread when a rocket randomly landed on that spot, instantly turning both of my uncle’s wives into widows and all his children into orphans. The younger wife remarried, but the older one remained a widow and lived with various relatives. One of her daughters later married one of my cousins, so she’s living with her son-in-law now."

My cousin and I were sitting on cushions in one such window seat, idling away the time, when suddenly we heard that high whistling sound that a rocket makes when it is passing overhead.

He made men’s suits, too, as well as jackets, vests, and winter coats. He cut out the parts, and his apprentices sewed them together according to his directions. You could find his products in stores all around Kabul, and they sold briskly, for they were every bit as stylish and sturdy as garments imported from abroad but were so much cheaper.

Everyone was there, waiting for us. Somehow all of them had already heard what had happened and had gathered. I don’t know how the news spread so quickly. I can only suppose that the rocket must have struck our house many hours before our return home. The news had reached everyone who was home to receive it. We didn’t hear about it because we were in the bazaar, moving about. No one knew where to find us."

But the moment I opened my mouth, someone gave me a hard slap across the face and said, “Your crying will distress her even more. You stop that crying and control yourself!”\n\nMost of my relatives stayed close to my mother that night. They clustered around her and held her and tried to comfort her. How she fared, I don’t know, because they shut me up in another room. I spent the night alone, a strange night, a night in which I had no thoughts that I can remember and no feelings. I just lay on the ground, curled up, inert, stunned, unable to feel, no different than a stone.\n\nFinally, the morning came, but the light seemed no different than darkness. It was like waking up from a nightmare only to find oneself still in a nightmare, and it was the same nightmare. The horror of yesterday merely became the horror of today. Everyone gathered around to solace me, all my girl-cousins, but I could not receive their sympathy or cheer. I snapped at them to leave me alone. Poor things had come to console me, and I ungraciously lashed out at them. I told them to forget about me."

How much less, then, could I sort out what was going on in the city as a whole and in the history of my country? If you’re locked in a noisy room, you can’t tell if the rest of the house is quiet or not, if the streets are deserted or filled with rioting mobs.\n\nOnly in retrospect do I understand that my father’s death was just one part of a momentous event that befell Afghanistan in that last week of September 1996. Three or four days after the rocket killed my family, the mujahideen slipped out of Kabul and retreated north, leaving the capital city to the Taliban, that terrible army of big-bearded boys. It was all part of the same cluster of events, the Taliban’s final battle for Kabul. I knew of this event only dimly Certainly, I knew nothing of its significance."

With the city in such turmoil, with no one sure what would happen next, no one dared to make suitable arrangements for our loved ones. A group of men hurried to our house, dug them out of the rubble, bore them to the cemetery, and buried them in haste. They told me to stay home. The cemetery was in the city, but you could not drive right up to it; you had to park far away and walk to the grave site—an arduous walk, people said. They told me that with my fused knee and prosthetic leg, I could not possibly make it from the car to my father’s grave to see him lowered into the earth. Actually, I could have walked that distance. I proved it later. But no one gave me credit. They thought of me as the poor cripple. I suppose they thought I might slow them down if trouble broke out and they had to run for it.

My shock and confusion had lifted enough to let the bigger world into my consciousness. And what entered into my awareness that day was the nothingness, the eerie silence. No guns went off for once, no bombs sounded, no rockets fell that day. You didn’t hear the sound of children playing. You didn’t hear cars. You didn’t hear dogs or donkeys or chickens, not even the hiss of bicycle tires. If you peeked out your door, you saw no one on the streets.

This time gangs of lawless Kabul residents went roving through the richer neighborhoods, breaking windows, tearing open doors, and snatching whatever they could snatch.

He made a lot of money until the Taliban had gotten such a firm grip on the city that more shopkeepers dared to open up for business.\n\nShut away in our houses as we were, we did not see any Taliban at first. We only heard them on the radio. They announced themselves. They said, “We are the Taliban, and we are here to stay.” They broadcast their rules. Women could not leave their compounds without male escorts. If they did go out, even with escorts, they had to wear a chadari, a baglike veil that covers a woman from head to foot. For some reason, Western reporters always call this type of veil a “burqa,” but in Afghanistan it is called a chadari. Also, everyone had to say namaz, the ritual Muslim prayer, at prescribed times. Men were forbidden to trim their beards. And so it went, their rules—on and on. The Taliban were just voices on the radio to us."

They became a normal part of our landscape, but they still looked frightening. You could tell at a glance which ones were Taliban, even from a distance, and not just because of their beards—for soon all men were growing their beards out to avoid flogging. Somehow the Taliban still stood out. Maybe it was the way they wrapped their turbans. Their clothing played a part too. Their shirts were longer than the usual Afghan outfit, and they always wore dark colors. Maybe it was their menacing swagger."

If we saw one on the street, we immediately wanted to change course, go some other way.\n\nThe four of us—my mother, my two brothers, and I— stayed with my uncle for two weeks. After that, with heavy hearts, we went back to our own house to sort through the rubble and see what was left. We used to have five buildings in our compound. Two were totally destroyed and one was badly damaged. We didn’t feel safe entering it. Two buildings remained structurally intact. The blast had blown out all the windows, but the rooms still had ceilings and doors. Our chickens were still alive, clucking about the yard. We decided to move back in and live in the rooms that remained.

Rapidly, we were learning that this was not just another mujahideen army, but something different. We heard about the floggings they administered to people who had broken their rules, especially to women they caught outdoors without male escorts or women they caught in public dressed—by their standards—immodestly.\n\nAt least in the days of the mujahideen, we women had the legal right to go out, go to school, and go to work, even if it was sometimes too dangerous to do these things. And women could go out wearing ordinary traditional clothes along with a head scarf and a neck scarf. And although, even in those days, some women did wear chadaris, they did so by choice—it was their custom. No one had to. The mujahideen disapproved of Western dress, and most of them had conservative standards; but within those limits, they allowed women to choose their own style of dress."

But if they caught a woman on the streets, she was in trouble.\n\nAt first most women could not go out at all because they did not even own chadaris. A few rummaged around in their storerooms and found some old moth-eaten chadari their mother or grandmother had worn thirty or forty or fifty years ago, but most families had thrown their chadaris away.\n\nGradually, however, all of us who did not already own a chadari bought one.

That mesh at eye level lets you see only what is straight ahead of you. You cannot really look down at your feet, and you have no peripheral vision. There is a technique to walking without tripping when you wear a chadari. You have to study the path ahead and memorize the landmarks, because as you move forward, the path disappears from view into the blind spot near your feet and on your two sides. If you see a curb coming, for example, you have to use your judgment as you approach it, as well as your memory, to figure out when you are there; and you have to feel for the curb with your toes, the way a blind man uses a cane. Otherwise, you can’t know when you’ve come to the curb, and you fall off, or at least you find it hard to step off at the right place. All this must be learned; but when you have two injured legs and one of them is made of plastic, the technique is difficult to master."

We were clotted into family groups. Some groups managed to get fires going, which added a feeling of cheer. They chatted quietly around their fires, and we could hear their voices. There was something companionable about it, really We were all just ordinary folks caught in a bad situation, sharing the same fate. No one there meant anybody harm."

It wasn’t bad. We did manage to catch some sleep.\n\nThen dawn came, and we again had to make our way to the road and try to get across that border. What else could we do? We could not go back, nor could we stay in that wasteland indefinitely. We had to get through. But once again, the guards were keeping the gate closed, beating and hitting anyone who got close enough each time the crowd rushed."

Throughout the day, while some of the guards confronted the crowds, a few others lounged over to the side. People approached them quietly. Money changed hands, and the guards then let those people quietly through a small door to the side. Hundreds could have flowed through the main gate had it been opened, but only one or two could get through the side door at a time. The fact that the guards were taking bribes did us no good whatsoever. We did not have the money to pay them. What little we had we would need to get from Peshawar to Quetta. And so the second day passed.\n\nAt the end of that day we found ourselves camping near a friendly family We struck up a conversation with them. The woman told us that her husband, Ghulam Ali, had gone to look for another way across the border. He was checking out a goat path that supposedly went over the mountains several miles northeast of the border station. If one could get to Pakistan safely by that route, he would come back for his family. “You can go with us,” the woman said."

You will need some rest before you attempt this mountain crossing. Spend tonight here and sleep well, knowing that you will have nothing to do tomorrow except lounge around, rest, and catch your breath. Tomorrow, do not throw yourself against those border guards again. Let your only work be the gathering of your strength. Then tomorrow night we will all go over the mountain together, with God’s grace. I will show you the way. If God wills it, we will follow that smugglers’ path to safety.

We sustained our strength. After sunset we lay down just as if we were going to spend another night. In fact, I did fall asleep for a while.

It was no use knowing that her difficulty was rooted in anxiety, just as it was no use knowing that we could have moved more quickly if we had possessed wings. Life is what it is. The path over that mountain was not actually very long, only a couple of miles. Steep as it was, we could have gotten over in little more than an hour if not for my mother.

These days I find it hard to clamber up two or three flights of stairs, even. I don’t know what made me so supple and strong that day, but I felt no hardship, no anxiety or fear, just concentration and intensity. Perhaps my mother’s problems distracted me from my own. That might account for it. Perhaps desperation gave me energy and made me forget the rigor of the climb. Well, whatever the reason, I scrambled up like a goat. The family we were following had a girl only a bit younger than me, and she was moving slowly. Her family used my example to chide her. They kept saying, “Look at that girl. She’s missing a leg, and yet she’s going faster than you. Why can’t you keep up? Hurry now!”"

They came to Quetta long before Pakistan even existed as a separate country. They gained Pakistani citizenship at the moment of the country’s birth. By this time they had deep roots in the city. Many of them have nice houses, big yards—all that stuff. The Hazara district in Quetta is called Mariabad. These former Afghan Hazaras speak a language all their own, a mixture of Farsi and Urdu, with a smattering of English stirred into the mix.\n\nDuring our one night in Peshawar, we asked everyone we met about my brothers: Had they seen anyone who fit that description? No one had any information. Everywhere we went in Quetta, we posed the same questions and got no answers.

When her mother said, “Did you give them their food?” this girl would say, “Oh, yes, A’ika, I gave them plenty, and they sure gobbled it up.” I, of course, had to keep my mouth shut and contain my angry thoughts. It seems hard to imagine, but if I had complained, it would have made things even worse.\n\nSometimes her mother would sit the two of us down and say, “Okay, girls, here are all these clothes. I want you to iron them together.” She acted like we were companions and that this would be a fun thing for us to do as a team. But as soon as the mother left, that girl would go watch television. Then, just before her mother was due home, she’d come back and pretend she had been working all along. When her mother entered the room, she would launch into loud complaints about my laziness, about how I had not helped her, how she had been forced to do all this ironing by herself, and then her mother would warn me to improve my behavior if I wanted to stay on the premises. It made me indignant, but there was nothing I could do about it."

My mother was sick, and if we got kicked out of this place, I didn’t know where I could take her. My mother knew what was going on, though. She knew how this girl was ordering me around, slandering me, and casting blame on me for the things she herself had done wrong; but my mother kept telling me, “Bear up. Let it go, Daughter. Do as she tells you. Don’t let it bother you.”\n\nAnd so because of my mother, I tolerated my situation. Much later, here in America, my friend Alyce showed us a tape one night, a movie called Cinderella. In the middle of the tape I started to cry. I thought I was crying for Cinderella, but looking back, I realize that I saw my own story in hers. That’s why Cinderella affected me so sharply.\n\nI grew tired of life itself in that house. My prosthetic leg was wearing out. The foot had cracked, and I could hardly walk on it anymore. Someone told my mother of a place in Quetta that made prosthetic limbs, so we went there one day. They had only ready-made prosthetics made of wood instead of plastic like mine. Wooden prosthetics are very heavy, and this shop had only big ones, made for men, large men."

He glued this man-size foot onto my girl’s prosthetic, and my mother and I headed home in a rickshaw.\n\nNear the house we got out of the rickshaw and started to walk the final block. Suddenly, the foot fell off. I tripped and fell, right there in the street. My mother panicked. “Stay there,” she shouted—as if I could go anywhere without my leg—and she ran to get us another rickshaw so we could return to the prosthetics shop.

I fell over again and had to drag myself out of the way on my knees, pushing and pulling myself with my hands. The bus driver slowed down to curse me for making him slow down and then sped off. In the meantime, neighborhood children clustered around me, chattering. I felt humiliated.\n\nMy mother came back with another rickshaw, and we returned to the prosthetics shop. The man admitted he had done a poor job, and he set about gluing the foot to my prosthetic more securely. As far as that went, he did a good job. I had a foot from then on, but it was heavy and ungainly and much larger than my other foot. Still, I had to make do, for it was better than no foot at all.\n\nMy mother’s asthma, meanwhile, kept getting worse. And with that girl constantly lording it over me, the whole world seemed to press down on my shoulders. Some days I thought I could not bear it. I thought, Oh, this weight! This weight is too heavy for me. This weight!"

When I came home from Germany and saw the pitiful state of Afghanistan, when I saw my people making war on one another every day, when I lost my family to the ravages of that war, I grew angry with God. Yes, angry with him. Why should I deny this? It’s the truth.\n\nIf God is there, I reasoned, if God is so nice, like they say—if God is so powerful—if he can really do anything in the world, why is he doing this? In the Koran, you know, it says that God is compassionate and all-forgiving. It says that God wants only the best for humanity. But how could I believe it? In fact, I was too distressed to pay much attention to believing in God. I was too beaten down by my hardships to worship him."

When the mullah chanted the aazan in the morning, I got up and washed myself and said a full set of prayers before anyone else in the household woke up. Throughout the day, when the call to prayer sounded, I stopped whatever I was doing, found a quiet spot, and turned my face to Mecca. No one dared tell me to stop performing the holy rituals and go back to doing household errands. Strangely enough, whenever I was absorbed in solitary prayer, I felt I had company. I felt somebody’s presence and tenderness embracing me."

People said it was on television, on the radio, and in the newspapers, but I never saw it or heard it or read it—I couldn’t read. I picked up the news from other people.

Outside, the pushing and shoving graduated to punching and pulling of hair. Women and children and the few men who happened to be there all began to raise such a commotion that the police had to come. A lot of wealthy property owners lived in that neighborhood, rich Pakistanis with marble-tiled houses and fragrant gardens. They didn’t want crowds of Afghan refugees clamoring and fighting in their leafy lanes. They told the Americans to process the refugees somewhere else.

About half an hour after leaving the city limits, we came to an isolated compound in the middle of an open field. In Pakistan, when people develop a property, they start by enclosing an area with high walls. After that, when they get to it, they erect structures inside the walls. Here, we saw no evidence of buildings inside the yard. No rooftops poked above the walls.

Again, on this second day, I couldn’t get to the front. I could only get close enough to see how the system worked. When the man came out, he pointed to the first person he saw. In order to be chosen, you had to be right there where his glance could fall on you. I kept trying that day, pulling my mother along, squirming and jostling our way forward, but I wasn’t strong enough to compete. Once I got tired, I couldn’t even hold our space. In the thickest middle of the crowd, bodies crushed in on us from every side. My mother couldn’t breathe. We had to fight to move back the way we had come, away from the door, back to where the crowd thinned out."

These windstorms turn day to dusk with the brown dust they whip up. Once this wind started up, we could do nothing but crouch with our backs to it, covering our faces with our head scarves. That’s how we all spent the next few hours, the many thousands of us assembled around that compound, men, women, children, and bawling babies. Yet, the whole time, the officials in the compound kept coming out every few minutes, kept calling refugees inside to process them.\n\nOn the third day we made our way pretty far forward early on. Suddenly, a man came out, and I saw that he was a Pakistani, not a foreigner. “Today we’re taking the wounded and disabled first,” he announced, and he stood there, looking out over the sea of people.\n\nHis eye fell glancingly on me. I waved my arm to hold his gaze and hobbled a step or two forward. “You there,” he called out. “Yes, you.” His stare remained fixed on me. “Come forward, girl. Come.” The crowd had to part to let my mother and me through. He said, “What is your story?”"

We all went through the gate.\n\nInside the yard, I saw one small hutlike structure. Otherwise, it was just an empty field, exactly the same as the desert landscape outside. In front of the hut a man sat at a simple desk, with an open ledger in front of him and a box of papers next to him. He gestured to a row of unpainted wooden benches against the wall and went back to marking figures in his book. We sat on that bench, our hearts booming, awaiting the next event, scarcely daring to believe we had actually gotten inside the compound, trying to keep our fears quiet and our hopes from going wildly out of control."

We had to wait a few hours for the Suzuki to take us back to the city, and we never went back to that field again, although I’m told they continued to take names there for another month or so.

In any case, I was not on the lookout for signs since I would not have been able to read them anyway. I assumed we were entering the American embassy. The Pakistani man who admitted us led the way to a room furnished only with carpets and chairs. Four or five other families were there already, waiting. Our appointment slip said eleven a.m., and we had arrived with time to spare, but they didn’t call my name until about three that afternoon. I didn’t mind the waiting itself—the room was comfortable; I just had trouble holding my tensions down all that time because I didn’t know what they would ask. I didn’t know if they would accept us or reject us.\n\nA well-dressed, middle-aged, businesslike Pakistani woman conducted the interview.\n\n“What is your name?” she asked.\n\nI told her.\n\n“And your mother’s name?”\n\nI answered this.\n\n“Where are you from?”"

So everything depends on getting to this appointment and, of course, on saying the right things when they talk to you. May God help you in your interview.”\n\nShe left unsaid the other outcome her words implied: If the embassy rejected us, we would not only lose our chance to go to America, but we would have to fund our own journey back to Quetta.\n\nWell, we scrimped, saved, and borrowed every rupee we could muster. We managed to collect enough to pay for our train tickets plus a little more for expenses and unexpected emergencies. We left with about a thousand rupees in all—the equivalent of about twenty dollars, I think."

The hungry-looking men with the big turbans and the kohl-rimmed eyes did not frighten us anymore, because we were used to people who looked like that. We knew it wasn’t what a man wore or how he painted his eyes that made him a Talib, but what smoldered in his heart. This time we embarked on our journey with a little more confidence, saying to each other, “We’ll make it.”\n\nAs soon as we arrived in Islamabad, we hailed a taxi and gave the driver the address of that hotel.\n\nThe cabbie was an Afghan himself, and he took a shine to us. But he knew all about the program to take a thousand widows to America. As soon as he saw two poor females in Muslim head scarves heading for an upscale, Western-style hotel, he said, “Ooh! By Allah, you two are in that program. You definitely have money.” Then he told us how much the ride to the hotel would cost."

Very sturdy, very muscular. “Four-shouldered,” we called such men in Kabul. “What’s wrong?” he asked.\n\nI couldn’t find my voice to tell him that we had no money, that we couldn’t pay him. The words caught in my throat. It would have been a lie anyway—we did have a little bit of money. I could only think, Oh, please, don’t take the little we have.\n\n“What’s wrong?” he kept saying. “Why are you crying? Tell me.”"

He wanted to help. Still, I could hardly get the words out through my sobs, and my mother did no better. But eventually, choking out a phrase here and a word there, we gave him enough fragments that he was able to piece together an idea of our problem. “Calm down, calm down,” he said compassionately. “All is not lost. Let us discuss this without tears and see what is to be done. What is it you really need? A ticket? Do you need a ticket for tomorrow’s train to Quetta? All right. Give me the one you have, and I will talk to the stationmaster. Come with me.”\n\nThen we followed him to the ticket counter, and he spoke firmly to the man. “These women have come a long way. Due to a traffic jam, they missed their train. They have no more money. Come, come, sir: Do the right thing. Stamp the tickets they have—renew them for tomorrow. What does it cost you? The money has already been paid. If there is no seat, they will sit on the floor.”"

There, he showed us a row of tiny rooms that the station rented to stranded travelers, just so they would have a safe place to sleep. Of course, the station usually collected rent, but the policeman let us have one of these little rooms for free. The better rooms had beds in them. Ours was just a cubicle, but we were grateful to have that. We slept on the bare floor, with our bundles as pillows and our head scarves as our only blankets. But at least we had a door to shut, a lock to turn, a safe corner to curl up in. We got some sleep that night.\n\nAnd it just goes to show that you can never tell. I feared that policeman on sight, because of his outfit, because of what the other policeman had done to us. But this one showed us nothing but compassion, he extended his hand to us, he comforted our grieving, and he gave us a place to sleep. You just can’t tell."

When the train opened its doors, we boarded and returned to Quetta without incident. The journey that had seemed so impossibly difficult three years ago seemed easy this time. We settled into our old life and waited for a phone call from the embassy.\n\nThis was in August of 2001.\n\nSeveral weeks later we woke up to the news of September 11: Terrorists had hijacked four planes in the United States—they had destroyed famous buildings in New York, they had crashed a plane into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and they had killed thousands of Americans.\n\nWe placed a frantic phone call to that agency in Quetta. Would this affect our flight? we wanted to know.\n\nThey said, “What flight? All flights to America have been canceled. As for that program to take a thousand Afghan widows to America—forget it. Osama bin Laden has turned the word ‘Afghan’ into mud. We don’t know when things will change, if ever.”\n\nThe next week the embassy finally called us. “Unpack your bags,” they said. “No one is going to America. We’ll be in touch if anything changes.”"

We were not afraid to dream when we closed our eyes, confident that our dreams would give us pleasure. After September 11 my mother said, “Well, that’s the end.” We grew listless. We went through our days like dead people who could still somehow walk. Nothing seemed to matter.\n\nAnd yet, deep down, I never lost that kernel of certainty. I had seen that star fall from the sky. I believed that God had shown me his power for a reason. He had shown me that he could take the mightiest life and plunge it into hell, and he could take the most wretched of beings and lift her to heaven. He could do anything. And I felt sure he would.\n\nAnd indeed he did. Six months crept by, and I don’t know what wheels were turning during that time, but in the seventh month we got a second message from the embassy. The program was on again; we should pack our bags. Tickets would be delivered to us. We would fly from Quetta to Islamabad the very next week, and from there, we would go on to America. It happened so suddenly! It felt like a miracle!"

We traveled together and got to know one another and became friends. One family consisted of a widower and his daughter. The other three were headed by widows, each of whom had four or five children, including some boys. Ours was the only family with no male members.\n\nThe airplane landed briefly in Holland and then went on to New York. There, we disembarked and were met by a small delegation of people who took us through customs. One of them was an Afghan; the rest were Americans. In Islamabad the embassy had given us some plastic bags with special insignias on the outside. We had been told to display these bags prominently when we arrived in America, so that the immigration officials would know who we were and not arrest us as terrorists. The bags contained all the official documents we needed to enter the United States.\n\nAfter we got through the entry procedures, the delegation split us into two groups. Four of the families were in one group, we were the other. The four families were all going to leave the airport, go to a hotel, and get a good night’s sleep. The next morning they would all board a plane for California."

It’s just a matter of where you have been placed.”\n\nMy mother did not believe him. “It’s because we don’t have a man in our family,” she told me bitterly. “The families with males get to go to a hotel. Those families get to go to California. We’re just women, so they’re not going to let us rest. If only we had a man in our family, they would let us go to California too. But, no!

I couldn’t sleep because I knew that as soon as we landed, I would have to begin dealing with whatever awaited us, and I didn’t know what that would be.\n\nIt was the middle of the night when we landed. We came off the plane, and I thought, Allah help us! Look at these lights! Look at this hurrying multitude! Look at the stores piled high with glittering merchandise. Look at these buildings, these gleaming floors, these paintings, this abundance, this bustle, this confusion! Listen to the announcements echoing and booming out of loudspeakers we can’t see!\n\nMy mother and I felt like ants in this vast universe of an airport. We looked about for people holding signs that said WELCOME in Farsi and English, but we saw no such people. We didn’t know where to find our bags and boxes containing the meager possessions we’d managed to accumulate in Pakistan over the years. The other passengers coming off the plane streamed around us, full of purpose. Two businessmen in almost identical suits caught my notice. “Let’s follow them,” I said. “They must be going to find their bags, so let us go there too.”"

In those crowds I was afraid we would lose sight of our businessmen and follow two others. We had to hurry to stay close to them. My mother had trouble walking that fast. She kept begging me to slow down, but I said, “No. They’re walking fast, we have to walk fast too. We have to find our boxes. If anyone is going to meet us, that’s where they will be waiting for us.”\n\nWell, we came at last to the room where passengers were picking up their luggage. We found the crowd that had come off our plane, and we waited with them. Eventually, we found all our bags, bundles, and boxes.\n\nAfter that we didn’t know what to do. We did not speak the language, we could not read the signs, and we did not know the rules of this place. Here, too, we looked for people holding some kind of welcome sign and didn’t see them. As it turned out, the caseworker from World Relief had gotten caught in a traffic jam or something. She was fully intending to be there when we arrived, but she was late."

We stood there among the mighty buildings and the bright lights, wearing exactly the clothes we customarily wore in Pakistan and before that in Afghanistan. We had our head scarves, our veils of modesty, wrapped tightly around our heads and chins and shoulders. In Pakistan wrapping ourselves this way gave us some anonymity, some protection from stares. Here, dressed in this manner, we stood out like ants in a sugar bowl. No one else looked the way we did. Everyone who passed by slowed down to stare at us. Finally, my mother started to cry, just like she did in that train station in Islamabad.\n\nI started to cry too. What were we doing here? Why had I insisted on this journey? How could we possibly make our way and secure a place for ourselves in this mighty maelstrom of a world? This was all my fault!"

They knew at once that they had found their clients from Afghanistan.\n\nOur caseworker, Zainab, came from Sudan. Years ago she had been a refugee like us. World Relief had brought her to America. She had found her footing here, gone to school, gotten her degree, and now she worked for the organization. She and her assistant greeted us. Her assistant, Aquila, was an Afghan woman, and she spoke Farsi. She let us know that we should go with them. They would take us to our new home.\n\nWe followed them in dutiful silence to a parking lot, a very long walk from the terminal. We all got into their van, Zainab and Aquila in the front, my mother and I in the back. Aquila started driving. My mother ogled the sights out her window. I gaped at the sights out mine—the lights, the traffic, the immense and numerous highways curving in and out among one another, over and under, like tangles of snakes."

We have barely arrived, and already they are giving us these gifts! I started to relax, thinking, I was right, America will turn out to be like Germany.\n\nBut then I sensed the tension next to me.

I tried to reassure my mother, but my voice had no confidence, and she trusted her own fearful instincts more than my halfhearted reassurances. No matter what J said, she just shook her head and said, “No, my child! The scales have fallen from my eyes. I see the truth now. All the things our neighbors said in Pakistan were true!” Her certainty began to sway me. Zainab and Aquila didn’t know what she was referring to, of course, but I knew, and her fear became my fear. She meant that we were going to be slaves here. There would be no comfortable house for us, no apartment of our own, no school for me, none of that.

The closer they came, the bigger they looked. We Hazaras are not a tall people. Strong, but not tall. To us, these people looked like giants. When my mother saw them looming next to the van, huge and fat and tall, her fear turned to utter terror. She tried to yank herself out of Aquila’s grip.

We heard the noise coming from her mouth and responded with uncomprehending looks. The man, poor fellow, brought us some milk, guessing that we would want it even if we did not admit to any hunger. He brought us some biscuits and some cookies. But my mother was trembling uncontrollably by this time. She ignored the cookies and milk, hugging herself all the more tightly, trying to warm herself up—fear makes a person cold. She was afraid of the food. She thought that at the very least it would contain ingredients forbidden by the dietary rules of Islam. She had heard, for example, that people in the West often use alcohol to make sweets, so she didn’t trust the cookies. And non-Islamic ingredients were the least of her anxieties. She worried that the cookies might be laced with sleeping potion or some kind of poison."

I tapped out those numbers and nothing happened. Then a mechanical voice said something in English. I hung up, my heart pounding. I didn’t know what to do.

They thought that since she was almost as new as we were in America, she would understand what was troubling us. When she finally arrived and heard what had been going on, she started trying to reassure us, just as the other Afghan woman, Aquila, had done. “What are you scared of? Don’t be scared. America isn’t like you think.”\n\nMy mother said, “Well, why can’t we come and stay with you?”\n\nFatima sighed. “All right. Please come home with me for lunch.” Then she said to the World Relief director, “Let me take these two home for now, and I’ll talk to them. I’ll get them to understand what you’re doing. They can’t stay with me, though. My house is too small, but I’ll talk to them and then take them back to the American sponsors. Maybe I can calm them down enough to make this work.”"

She trusted that it would not contain pork or liquor. It was the first meal she could eat without dread and doubt since we arrived in America. After the meal we fell fast asleep, and we were able to do this because we felt safe in Fatima’s house.\n\nAt dusk our original translator, Aquila, came over. She took us all to her house for dinner. Over a good meal she told my mother, “Have patience, Auntie-dear. Don’t jump to conclusions. You’re new to this world, You must accept that some of your judgments and ideas may be mistaken. It’s natural to be afraid, but before you make any decisions based on fear, take some time to get to know these people and their customs. Slowly, you will begin to understand how it is here. Then you’ll find some peace of mind. For now, trust the people who have been here longer. Take what we’re telling you on faith, because we know how things are here and you simply don’t.”\n\nSo we ate with her, and then she agreed to let us stay at her house that night, but only that one night, just so we could get one good night’s sleep. In the morning, she warned us, we would have to go back to the Americans."

Two men put my mother on a stretcher and rushed her out to their van.\n\nI went running after them, shouting, “Wait for me!”\n\nAquila followed me out. “You can’t go in the ambulance,” she informed me. “Come in my car. We will follow them to the hospital.”\n\nWell, the ambulance took off much faster than we could go, but Aquila knew where they were going. By the time we arrived at the hospital, they had rushed my mother to a room. Aquila helped me figure out where she was. I could never have dealt with the nurses and clerks and officials in that hospital by myself. I could never have explained who I was or made known what I wanted, but with Aquila’s help, we found out my mother’s room number and got permission to go up there."

Let them do their work.”\n\nSeveral hospital workers helped Aquila hold me back. With my arms restrained, I watched a doctor approach my mother with a hypodermic. He injected medicine into her arm, medicine that was supposed to open up her air passages, I guess. He did not know that my mother was allergic to that medicine. He never thought to ask me. I didn’t know to tell him. I couldn’t speak to them properly, and anyway, I figured they were doctors, so they must know what they were doing. This was America. It was like Germany. The doctors here were all experts. So I watched the man give my mother that shot, and within seconds—seconds!—her body jerked, her eyes closed, and she fell back against her pillow, to all appearances—dead.\n\nThe doctors went into a frenzy of motion, bustling about my mother, shouting orders at one another, calling for equipment and medications and I don’t know what else.

Just let the doctors do their work.”\n\nA few moments later one of the medical people came out, wiping his hands on a cloth. “Tell her,” he said to Aquila, “that her mother is stable. We’ve got her on a respirator, she’s getting oxygen, and that’s good. Tell her that she’s still unconscious, but her vital signs are good.”\n\nAnd Aquila told me, “Your mother is sleeping.

Zainab helped us with this application. Then she helped us apply for public aid. Thanks to World Relief, my mother and I began receiving food stamps. We got on social security and started getting payments for being disabled. We got into a program that allowed us to see doctors and get medical care. Eventually, World Relief helped us move to an apartment in a subsidized housing complex, which brought our rent down to a level we could afford on our disability payments.\n\nBoth my mother and I needed a lot of medical help in those first few months.

We dreaded those rides to the hospital.\n\nThose taxi drivers always took the most circuitous routes to our destinations, so as to fatten their fares—we were not paying them, but somebody was.

Every day, one way or another, I learned a few more phrases. In any case, I had to take charge because my mother let go of decisionmaking altogether.

According to people in Pakistan, the images on American television are so indecent, a single momentary glimpse of them could corrupt a young girl like me. For this reason, my mother would not let me turn on our new television at first, lest I see something harmful to me before we could switch the channel or turn off the set.\n\nBut after a hard day of studying English and struggling with the complications of living in America, I wanted to relax. I wanted to watch TV at night. Eventually, I convinced my mother to let me turn it on, but she always sat next to me to guard me against corruption. She would not let me watch television late at night, nor would she let me watch television by myself.\n\nShe still maintains those rules, but we do watch television every night now. Alyce and John have gotten us a cable service called “the family package.” It provides only such shows as a young girl like me can watch safely. I have a few programs I watch regularly now, such as Fear Factor. On that show, people compete for prizes by doing unusual stunts. Yes, these include things like eating ants and snails. It does turn your stomach, sort of, but I enjoy it."

She watches for stories about our part of the world. If I’m not in the room when a segment about Afghanistan or Pakistan comes on, she yells out, “Farah! It’s Kabul. Come quick! What are they saying?” We have been here for three years, but she doesn’t speak much English yet, just a few scattered words. She needs me to translate everything.\n\nAll of the new clothes, pots, pans, kitchenware, phone, television, and other goods changed our life, but not nearly as much as Alyce herself She said she would come once a week, but she started coming much more often.

When she asked me “Where do you come from?” I wanted to tell her the whole history of my life. Even that first time, after she left, I was tingling with excitement. I said to myself, I can’t be shy with this one. I have to open up and give her a chance to know who I am. She will be my friend to the end.\n\nOnce we started spending time together, my English improved rapidly. We talked about every subject, so I learned the words I needed for all those different subjects. My vocabulary grew like weeds in a garden. Alyce let me ask questions of any kind and follow my curiosity wherever it led. She taught me how to become an American by telling me about the culture and customs here—what the holidays are, for example, and how you celebrate each one. She told me how to behave in a restaurant. I learned that your napkin should go on your lap. I didn’t know that before."

The store keeps track of what has been bought, and thus the bride and groom get just the wares they want with no duplicates. It is so well organized!\n\nAlyce told me about dating and how people don’t consider it a scandal here when two people go out together. It’s kind of normal. She said that if a young man and a young woman go out alone without their parents or an older relative along to keep watch, it’s not that big of a deal. In fact, this is how people are supposed to meet in America, I discovered.\n\nI asked Alyce how she and her husband met and how he proposed, and she told me the whole story. They met in college, it turned out. One of Alyce’s friends knew John, and this friend said to Alyce one day, “How about going out for a drink with me tonight? I know a couple of boys who will join us.” John was one of those boys. That was how he and Alyce met, and then later they started going on dates alone, just the two of them."

She said, “I’m tired, and I want to go home. If you want to say something to me, say it now!”\n\nAnd that’s when he finally blurted out, “Will you marry me?” That’s how it happened. They were engaged for a year, and then finally they got married.\n\nAlyce invited us to her house for Thanksgiving that first year. We had never seen a turkey before and didn’t know what it was. We never imagined a bird could grow so big. My mother didn’t eat any of it. She knew it wasn’t a pig because she saw that it had wings, but she suspected—correctly—that it had not been slaughtered in accordance with the ritual requirements of Islam, so it wasn’t halal. She ate the potatoes and the vegetables, though, and she enjoyed those. In any case, I learned all about Thanksgiving from Alyce, and I learned the words that go with that holiday."

You could get an idea of what life was like back then, and what people believed, and why and how they turned their kings and other famous dead people into mummies. In second grade I marveled to learn merely that other countries existed, countries where people rode trains and went about bareheaded and spoke languages unlike mine. Now I discovered that the world was even more inconceivably various than I had imagined back then.\n\nAt this museum they had room-size boxes showing scenes of everyday life as it existed in this very area, less than two hundred years ago. They showed how the native people lived at that time—in houses made of animal skins, wearing clothing made of fur, using tools made of reeds and bones….The scenes showed how they hunted animals with bows and arrows and traveled from place to place on rivers in handmade canoes of tree bark. They showed everything."

In fact, these were the real and original Americans—and yet they were so undeveloped, even compared to Afghans. They did not know about science and machinery and modern technology until the British came. It made me ponder why some ways of life succeed and spread while others succumb to time and vanish. It made me think about the differences that exist today between America and Afghanistan and why my homeland is mired in such difficulties and why it can’t seem to shake its way out of its problems.\n\nI also saw dinosaurs at this museum. I had never heard of dinosaurs before I came to America. Now I saw the skeletons of these monsters and models of what they looked like. I saw a film about the people who find dinosaur bones.

I was running as hard as I could, and I turned my head to see if it was gaining, and at that very moment it took off in one tremendous bounding leap that lifted it into the air and brought it arcing toward me. The sun vanished in its shadow, and its shadow grew around me as it descended, down and down until—whump! The impact of its body on mine woke me up.\n\nYes, I woke up with a jolt, because my teddy bear had fallen off a shelf, onto my neck.

I never really felt sick, and I rode that boat without any fear, even though we sailed until we could no longer see land in any direction.

They tried to distract me from the motion by giving me food. They gave me lots and lots of food, but it didn’t help. I found the whole experience pretty interesting at the time, but later I realized it exhausted me, because as soon as we got home, I fell asleep, and I more or less slept for two days.

At the end of the semester, however, I took part in my class’s recital. A few weeks before the show the teacher presented each of us with a list of tunes and asked us to pick one. I chose a song called “Money Can’t Buy You Love.” I practiced it every day and then played it at the recital. All the parents came to watch the performance. My mother was there, and so was my “other mother,” Alyce. The Indian girl’s parents came too. I made a few mistakes, but it didn’t matter. The parents all enjoyed the show. They would have clapped no matter how or what we played."

All I learned there were the small numbers. In school I never learned the big numbers. Later, in Pakistan, somehow or other, I learned to add, subtract, and even divide a little, just from handling money Along the way I picked up a few of the multiplication tables, too—maybe half of them. When I was tested for basic math skills and they gave me problems that involved adding or subtracting, I could do them. I could do division problems, too, but only with small, even numbers. If three- or four-digit numbers were involved, I got lost. And if a subtraction problem involved borrowing, I couldn’t do that, either. They put me in basic math that first year, but since I progressed quickly, they decided to bump me ahead to pre-algebra toward the end of the year.\n\nThere, I didn’t do so well, in part because I couldn’t follow the teacher’s English. And since I couldn’t learn anything from his explanations, I had to watch what he wrote on the chalkboard and try to figure out what he might be saying. The math had gotten ahead of my English. I wanted to drop back, but the counselor told me, “No, stick with what you’re doing. You’ll catch up eventually.”"

And this year, in American history class, I learned how this country was founded. I read how the European settlers fought with the Indians. I realized that there was some kernel of truth to the stories people were telling in Pakistan. Americans did at one time import people from other continents and keep them here as slaves. The Europeans who came to this land did fight with the native people, and terrible things happened.

The same people have been living there for thousands of years, with one culture, one way of life, one religion—and yet, oh, how far behind they have fallen! Here, where people from many cultures, many religions, and many parts of the planet have come together, they have built such an advanced society. It amazes me.\n\nI ask myself why this is so. Why has America done so well?\n\nIn our American history class I read that when people came here from so many places, they came with ambition, they came to start over, and they worked hard. That’s probably part of it. Also, they were able to raise their voices here. They were able to express themselves and search for their own beliefs and say what they believed out loud. I think that is why America has developed so remarkably. Here, people can live their lives without fear. In places like Afghanistan, by contrast, everybody is afraid. Nobody dares to raise his voice. I think America has grown strong because it lets everyone take a part."

If you invent something, people will congratulate you and take an interest in your invention. There, they will say, “Why did you invent this thing? We don’t want something different! What was wrong with what we had before?” Here, you can announce your opinion, and if you’re against something, you can say so and it becomes part of the discussion, not a reason why you have to go into hiding.\n\nI don’t know why such differences exist among countries, but I think it’s important that in America the law says you can express yourself. I think the Bill of Rights makes the big difference. The Bill of Rights gives Americans the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom to meet and gather and make plans."

A lady came out of the clinic as we were heading toward the door. This woman had a prosthetic leg. If you yourself have a prosthesis, you can always tell when someone else has one. I noticed this woman as soon as she came out of the building. I watched her go to one of the cars in the parking lot. I assumed that she was going to go to the passenger’s side, and I wondered where her driver might be. Instead, to my surprise, she opened the door on the driver’s side. I said, “Whoa! Is she going to drive that thing?” I slowed down to watch, and indeed that is just what she did do. She got in, shut the door, turned on the engine, and zoom—she went driving off!\n\nI nudged Alyce. “Did you see that woman? She had a prosthesis, yet she drove that car!”\n\nAlyce said, “Well!

She found a place in Wheaton called the Marianjoy Rehab Hospital, which had a special program that helped people like me learn to drive. They charged money, however, and I could not afford their services. So Alyce talked to administrators at my high school. She said, “You’re supposed to offer driver’s education to all your students.

When I showed it to the girl who said I could never do it, she frowned and got all sulky."

She phoned around to all the organizations she knew about, all the churches, all her friends. Alyce knows a lot of people from her work with LOVE Christian Clearinghouse. She asked everyone she knew to ask everyone they knew if anyone had a car they might want to donate to me.\n\nSomeone suggested that she contact a man named Chris Gossett. She called this fellow and explained the situation, and he wanted to help. During the conversation he revealed that he was a dentist by profession, but as a side business and hobby, he bought old cars, fixed them up, and sold them. He didn’t have a suitable car at that moment, he said, but he would keep an eye out for one. In the meantime, he offered to look at my teeth. Dr. Gossett is a really nice, gentle man.\n\nAlyce took me in to see him, and after an examination he declared my teeth in terrible shape. He said my gums were a wreck and he would have to deep-clean them. “Make an appointment,” he said, “and I’ll do the work for free.” And he did.\n\nAnyway, one day Dr. Gossett called John and said, “I have found a car. It’s in Holland, Michigan.”"

He took some pictures and brought them back to me—and, oh my gosh, the car was red!\n\nI said, “I want that car. Whatever it takes, that’s the car I want!”\n\nWell, John could not act on the matter right away because he had another business trip scheduled, but when he came back, two days later, he called Dr. Gossett at once and said, “Okay, she wants that Dodge Neon.”\n\nDr. Gossett said, “You waited too long. That car found a buyer.”\n\nI pouted for two days. Alyce called Dr. Gossett and said “She’s devastated. Can’t you dig up another car for her? This is serious.”\n\nDr. Gossett said, “Actually, I think I have just the one—it’s a Mercedes-Benz.”\n\nOh, Alyce and John came to me, all smiles! “Don’t you fret anymore,” they said. “Dr. Gossett has found another car for you.”\n\n“What color is it?” That was all I wanted to know.\n\nThey couldn’t answer that question. “It’s a Mercedes,” they informed me.\n\nI didn’t know the word “Mercedes.” I thought they were naming a color. I said, “What’s Mercedes?”\n\nThey said, “Never mind. Just go have a look at it. See what you think.”"

I didn’t mind the size, actually—I even liked a smaller car—but I didn’t like the looks of it: the boxy style, that old-fashioned grill, and the color—it was a sort of dull gold, I felt all disappointed and sullen. The big red car appealed to my fantasies—it looked modern to me and, best of all, it was red! I love red.\n\nEveryone was saying, “But, girl, this is a Mercedes, a famous brand. It will run for a long time without breaking down.”\n\nI said to myself, Well, the red car is gone. I will have to settle for a Mercedes. It won’t be so bad. At least it’s a car.\n\nLater, when I told people I had a Mercedes-Benz, they always gasped. Other Afghans were agog to learn what model of car I was driving: They couldn’t believe it. Gradually, I came to realize that I have something quite special here. It’s pretty old, of course, but it runs very well. I found out later as well that it belonged to Dr. Gossett’s wife. She bought herself a new car, and that’s when she decided to give the old one to us."

I had started out in Lombard High. Now I’m going to Wheaton North. The ESL department at my new high school has an international club. Kids from other countries meet every Wednesday after school to play games, talk, and have fun. Ms. Ascadam, the teacher who sponsors this group, came from Sudan when she was four or five years old. World Relief helped her get to America. Now she’s all grown up, she has finished college, and she has a good job. It was she who organized this multicultural club, and she still runs it.\n\nI had nothing to do with the multicultural club when I first came to Wheaton High School because I could not stay at school after hours. I always had to rush home to study and take care of my mother’s needs. Late last year, however, in the second semester, my life eased up somewhat and I decided to join the club. Right around that time Ms. Ascadam had decided that the international kids should throw a party at the end of the year and present a show. She told us each to bring food from our country to the party, and she encouraged us to think about participating in the show as well."

The mere fact that I wanted to participate outraged her. Suddenly, she called out to the teacher. “Ms. Ascadam,” she said, “when you model clothes at a fashion show, isn’t this how you have to walk? Isn’t this how models walk on a runway?”"

She would just spoil the whole thing, wouldn’t she?” And she kept walking back and forth, swinging from side to side.\n\nIt made me so angry, because I knew that she was really saying, Farah can’t do this.

They arrived exactly at four! Drenched with relief, I hurried to the dressing room to get ready. I had time, because the dancing group was going on first.

We could hear people fighting out there, and the noise of traffic disturbed us at all hours. Sometimes at night the cars sounded like they were going to drive right through our walls and into our bedroom.\n\nThen we moved to Carol Stream, which is about ten minutes from Glendale Heights by car.
