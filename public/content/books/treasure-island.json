          "text": "About The Author\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson was born over a hundred years ago in Scotland. All through his childhood Stevenson was sick and could not attend school regularly. But bad health did not affect Stevenson’s high spirits. In college he was known as a wild young man who refused to cut his long hair and wore velvet jackets. He became familiar with Edinburgh’s underworld and used his colorful experiences there in his writings.\n\nAfter college Stevenson traveled from one European health resort to another in search of a cure for his tuberculosis. In Paris he met an older American woman and fell in love with her. When she returned to America he followed. After divorcing her husband, she married Stevenson—despite the scandal.\n\nStevenson wrote Treasure Island for his wife’s son. Cooped up in an English cottage, Stevenson drew a map of an imaginary island—Treasure Island—to amuse his stepson. Stevenson became fascinated by the map he had drawn. He carefully studied the shape of the island—the two harbors, the mountains. Then the idea for an adventure story came to him and he quickly outlined a series of chapters."

          "text": "Treasure Island was Stevenson’s first popular success. He followed this with the classic book of poetry for young people, A Child’s Garden of Verses. After that his next book was the tale of a man with two personalities, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Stevenson was now an established author. His health had improved after a stay at a resort in New York State and he decided to travel. With his wife and stepson, he sailed from San Francisco on a voyage to the South Seas (islands in the South Pacific).\n\nStevenson traveled in the South Seas for over a year before deciding to live there. The gentle climate and friendly people of Samoa charmed him. He decided to buy land there. Stevenson admired the native people. He wrote a book criticizing the way Europeans had treated the Samoans. Because of this book Stevenson became very popular with the native people. The Samoans called him Tusitale, meaning “teller of tales.”\n\nStevenson lived for five years on Samoa until his death at the age of 44. Despite his brief life he published many excellent novels, stories, and poems. After Stevenson died the native people learned of his desire to be buried on top of a mountain “under the wide and starry sky.” The native people cleared a path through the jungle to a mountain top so that Stevenson would have his wish."

          "text": "Preface\n\nThe discovery of the New World brought great riches to Spain. Spanish soldiers plundered the Indian empires and then sent their loot home by boat. These Spanish treasure boats were tempting prizes for sailors of other countries. Because England was Spain’s traditional enemy, English sailors were encouraged by their rulers to raid Spanish ships. The English raiders, called “Sea Dogs,” were not considered pirates; they were thought of as adventurers who gave the king or queen a portion of any prize they captured.\n\nIn time, England and Spain made peace. The English were no longer allowed to attack Spanish ships. Ships were laid up and crews discharged. Many English sailors were unable to find work and they had to return to the sea as pirates. These angry sailors raided the ships of any nation. The “Golden Age of Piracy” had begun.\n\nPiracy had great appeal for many sailors. Besides offering the chance to make a quick fortune, life aboard a pirate ship was much freer than life in the British Royal Navy. Most pirate ships operated under the rules of a written constitution. Before each voyage, the crew would draw up and sign this document listing the rules of shipboard life and the punishments for violating these rules. Pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be replaced by them. In the British Royal Navy the captains had total control over their crews. But a pirate captain had to keep his crew’s favor or risk losing the position."

          "text": "Pirates went to sea “on account,” which meant that each pirate was a shareholder in the ship’s company. The pirates’ fortunes depended on the ships they raided. The saying “No prey, no pay” summed up the situation.\n\nMost pirates were either captured or forced to give up their profession by the early 1800s. But as their strength declined, tales about pirates grew. One popularly held belief is that pirates buried great treasures. Some pirates did in fact bury their treasures, but not many. Pirates generally spent their prize money in the nearest port. With such an uncertain life, pirates were determined to live only for the moment."

Accordingly, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17—, and go back to the time when my father kept the “Admiral Benbow” inn, and the brown old seaman with the sword cut first took up his lodging under our roof.\n\nI remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came walking up to the inn door, his sea chest following behind him in a cart; a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man; his pigtail* falling over the shoulders of his soiled blue coat; his hands ragged and rough, with black, broken nails; and the sword cut across one cheek, a dirty white. I remember him looking round the bay and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea song that he sang so often afterward:\n\n“Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—\nYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”"

This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.\n\n“This is a handy bay,” says he, at length; “and a pleasant spot for an inn. Much company, mate?”*\n\nMy father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.\n\n“Well, then,” said he, “this is the inn for me. Here you, mate,” he cried to the man who wheeled the sea chest, “bring up alongside and help me get my chest up. I’ll stay here a bit,” he continued. “I’m a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that cliff up there where I can watch for ships. What might you call me? You might call me captain. Oh, I see what you want—there!” And he threw down three or four gold pieces on the floor. “You can tell me when I’ve worked through that,” says he, looking as fierce as a commander.\n\nThe man who came with the sea chest told us that the old seaman had asked questions about the inns that were along the coast, and hearing ours was a good inn but lonely, had chosen it for his lodgings. And that was all we could learn of our guest."

All evening he sat in a corner of the parlor next the fire, and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly he would not speak when spoken to; only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a foghorn. And we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day, when he came back from his walk, he would ask if any seamen had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the lack of sailor friends that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he wished to avoid them. When a seaman put up at the “Admiral Benbow” (as now and then some did), he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlor. He was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter; for I, in a way, shared in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day, and promised me a silver fourpenny* on the first of every month if I would only keep my “weather eye open for a seaman with one leg,” and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough, when the first of the month came round, and I asked him for my pay, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down. But before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my fourpenny piece, and tell me again to look out for “the seaman with one leg.”"

Altogether I paid pretty dear for my fourpenny piece, in the shape of these terrible dreams."

There were nights when he took a good deal more rum and water than his head would carry. Then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild, sea songs, noticing nobody. Sometimes he would call for glasses for everyone, and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or sing a chorus to his songs. Often I have heard the house shaking with “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,” all the neighbors joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other, hoping not to be noticed. Sometimes he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round. He would fly up in anger at a question; or sometimes because none was asked, and he thought the company was not following his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy, and had gone up to bed."

By his own story he must have lived his life among some of the most wicked men that God ever allowed upon the sea. The language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon stop coming there to be frightened and sent shivering to their beds. But I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it. It was a fine excitement in a quiet country life. There was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a “true sea dog,” and a “real old salt,”* and such names."

I am sure the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.\n\nAll the time he lived with us the captain made no change in his dress except to buy some stockings. Part of his hat fell down, and he let it hang from that day forth. I remember the look of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbors, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea chest none of us had ever seen open."

In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean—silence. The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey’s. He went on as before, speaking clear and kind, and drawing rapidly at his pipe between every word or two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a low oath, “Silence, there, between decks!”\n\n“Were you speaking to me, sir?” said the doctor. The pirate told him, with another oath, that this was so. “I have only one thing to say to you, sir,” replied the doctor, “that if you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be rid of a very dirty rascal!”"

The bay was all gray with frost, the ripple sounding softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops. The captain had risen earlier than usual, and set out down the beach, his cutlass* swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat on the back of his head.

Try and I’ll help you to your bed.”\n\nBetween us, with much trouble, we got him upstairs, and laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow, as if he were almost fainting.\n\n“Now, mind you,” said the doctor, “drinking rum is death for you.”\n\nAnd with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the arm.\n\n“This is nothing,” he said, as soon as he had closed the door. “I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile. He should lie for a week where he is—that is the best thing for him and you. But another stroke would settle him.”\n\n* Cutlass: a short, heavy sword, often used by sailors."

He seemed both weak and excited.\n\n“Jim,” he said, “you’re the only one here that’s worth anything. And you know I’ve been always good to you. Never a month but I’ve given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I’m pretty low, and deserted by all. Jim, you’ll bring me one glass of rum, now, won’t you, matey?”\n\n“The doctor—” I began."

And I lived on rum, I tell you. It’s been meat and drink to me. If I’m not to have my rum now, I’ll die, Jim, and it will be your fault, and that doctor’s.” He ran on again for a while with curses. “Look, Jim, how my fingers shake,” he continued, in a pleading tone. “I can’t keep them still, not I. I haven’t had a drop this whole day. That doctor’s a fool, I tell you. If I don’t have a drink of rum, Jim, I’ll have the horrors. I seen some already. I seen old Cap’n Flint in the corner there behind you. As plain as print, I seen him. If I get the horrors, I’m a man that has lived rough, and I’ll be sure to make trouble. Your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn’t hurt me. I’ll give you a golden coin for a glass, Jim.”\n\nHe was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me, for my father, who was very low that day, needed quiet.

The rascals are plotting against me this very moment. They couldn’t keep what they got, and want to steal what is mine. I’m a saving soul.

On the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever, and it was shocking, in that house of mourning, to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea song. Weak as he was, we were all afraid that he might die, and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away, and was never near the house after my father’s death. I have said the captain was weak. Indeed he seemed to grow weaker rather than stronger. He climbed upstairs and downstairs, and went from the parlor to the bar and back again. Sometimes he put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to the walls as he went, and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain. He never spoke directly to me, and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his talk with me. But his temper was more uncertain and more violent than ever. He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it before him on the table. But, with all that, he paid less attention to people, and seemed shut up in his own thoughts. At times his mind seemed to wander. Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up a different tune, a kind of country love song that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea."

He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick, and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose. He was stooped, as if with age or weakness. He wore a huge, old, ragged sea cloak with a hood, that gave him a queer shape. I never saw in my life a more dreadful looking figure. He stopped a little distance from the inn. Raising his voice in an odd singsong, he spoke to the air in front of him.\n\n“Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes—where or in what part of this country he may now be?”\n\n“You are at the ‘Admiral Benbow,’ Black Hill Cove, my good man,” said I.\n\n“I hear a voice,” said he—“a young voice.

I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and toward the parlor, where our sick old pirate was sitting. The blind man held tight to me with one iron fist, and leaned almost more of his weight on me than I could carry. “Lead me straight up to him, and when I’m in view, cry out, ‘Here’s a friend for you, Bill.’ If you don’t, I’ll do this,” and with that he gave me such a twist that I thought I would faint.

Some of the man’s money—if he had any—was certainly due to us. But it was not likely that our captain’s shipmates, above all the two seen by me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would care to give up any of the money to pay the dead man’s debts. The captain’s order to mount at once and ride for Dr. Livesey would have left mother alone which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed impossible for either of us to stay much longer in the house. The fall of coals in the fireplace, the very ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms. The neighborhood, to our ears, seemed filled with the sound of footsteps coming toward us. The thought of the dead body of the captain on the parlor floor, and of that horrible blind beggar waiting near at hand and ready to return, filled us with terror. There were moments when I “jumped out of my skin” for fright. Something must be done at once. We decided at last to go out together and seek help in the neighboring village. No sooner said than done.

For—you would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselves—no man would consent to return with us to the “Admiral Benbow.” The more we told of our troubles, the more they wished to stay in their houses. The name of Captain Flint was well enough known to some there, and carried a great deal of terror. Some of the men who had been at work in a field on the other side of the “Admiral Benbow” remembered that they had seen several strangers on the road and one at least had seen a little fishing vessel on the bay. For that matter, anyone who was a comrade of the captain’s was enough to frighten them to death.

Almost at the same time a pistol shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. That was plainly the last signal of danger, for the pirates turned at once and ran, separating in every direction. One ran toward the sea along the bay, one across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. They deserted him and there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a fury, and calling for his comrades. Finally he took the wrong turn, and ran a few steps past me toward the village, crying:\n\n“Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,” and other names, “you won’t leave old Pew, mates—not old Pew!”\n\nJust then the sound of horses galloping came over the top of the hill, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight, and swept at full speed down the slope.\n\nAt this Pew saw his mistake, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second, and made another dash, now not knowing where to go, right under the nearest of the coming horses."

I soon saw who they were. One, coming up behind the rest, was the lad that had gone from the village to Dr. Livesey’s. The rest were officers whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had the good sense to return at once. Some news of the fishing vessel in the bay had found its way to Mr. Dance, the chief officer, and sent him out that night in our direction. To that fact my mother and I owed our lives."

My mother, when we had carried her up to the village, was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to wish she had taken the rest of the money. In the meantime, Mr. Dance rode on toward the bay where the fishing vessel had been seen. He was not surprised, when he and his men got down to the water’s edge, to find that the vessel was already under way, though still close to shore. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the vessel rounded the point and disappeared.\n\n“They’ve got off clean, and that’s the end of it. Only,” he added, “I’m glad Master Pew did not get away,” for by this time he had heard my story.\n\nI went back with him to the “Admiral Benbow.” You cannot imagine a house in such a state of ruin. The very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself.

The door was opened almost at once by the maid.\n\n“Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked.\n\nNo, she said. He had come home in the afternoon, but had gone up to the squire’s* to dine and pass the evening with him.\n\n“So there we go, boys,” said Mr. Dance.\n\nWe went to the gates, and up the long moonlit avenue to the squire’s home. Here Mr. Dance got off his horse, and, taking me along with him, was let into the house.\n\nThe servant led us down a long passage, and showed us into a great library, all lined with books, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire.\n\nI had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was a tall man, over six feet high, and broad as well. He had a bluff, rough-and-ready face, all roughened and reddened and lined from his long travels. His eyebrows were very black and moved often, and this gave him a look of some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.\n\n“Come in, Mr. Dance,” says he.\n\n“Good evening, Dance,” says the doctor, with a nod. “And good evening to you, friend Jim. What good wind brings you here?”"

You should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest. When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his leg, and the squire cried “Bravo!” and knocked the ashes from his long pipe. Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire’s name) had got up from his seat, and was walking rapidly about the room. The doctor, as if to hear better, had taken off his powdered wig, and sat there, looking very strange indeed with his own short black hair.\n\nAt last Mr. Dance finished the story.\n\n“Mr. Dance,” said the squire, “you are a very noble fellow. And as for riding down that black rascal, I think it a good deed, sir. This lad Hawkins is brave, I see. Hawkins, will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have some wine.”\n\n“And so, Jim,” said the doctor, “you have the thing that they were after, have you?”\n\n“Here it is, sir,” said I, and gave him the oilskin package.\n\nThe doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers ached to open it. But, instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat."

Mr. Dance was further praised, and at last dismissed.\n\n“And now, squire,” said the doctor.\n\n“And now, Livesey,” said the squire, in the same breath.\n\n“One at a time, one at a time,” laughed Dr. Livesey. “You have heard of this Flint, I suppose?”\n\n“Heard of him!” cried the squire. “Heard of him, you say! He was feared more than any pirate that ever sailed the seas.”\n\n“Well, I’ve heard of Captain Flint myself,” said the doctor. “But the point is, had he money?”\n\n“Money!” cried the squire. “Have you heard Jim’s story? What were these rascals after but money? What do they care for but money? For what would they risk their rascal necks but money?”\n\n“That we shall soon know,” replied the doctor. “What I want to know is this: supposing that I have here in my pocket some hint of where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?”"

It contained two things—a book and a sealed paper.\n\n“First of all we’ll try the book,” observed the doctor.\n\nThe squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly made a sign to me to come round from the side table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the mark on the captain, “Billy Bones.” There was also, “Mr. W. Bones, mate.” “No more rum.” “Off Palm Key he got itt,” and some other bits, mostly single words that we could not make out. I could not help wondering who it was that had “got itt,” and what “itt” was that he got. A knife in his back as likely as not."

There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account books. But instead of any writing to explain each sum, only a number of crosses was between the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of 70 pounds had plainly been paid to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause.\n\nThe record lasted over nearly 20 years, the amount of the sums growing larger as time went on. At the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words added, “Bones, his pile.”\n\n“I can’t make head or tail of this,” said Dr. Livesey.\n\n“The thing is as clear as noonday,” cried the squire. “This is the black-hearted hound’s account book. These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or robbed. The sums are the rascal’s share, and where he feared the account would not be clear, you see he added something clearer. ‘Off Caraccas,’ now.

The very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain’s pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and out fell the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, depth of the water along the coast, names of hills and bays, and every bit of information that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe harbor upon its shores. The island was about nine miles long and five across and had two fine harbors, and a hill in the center part marked “The Spyglass.” There were several additions of a later date; but, above all, three crosses in red ink—two on the north part of the island, one in the southwest. Beside this last, in the same red ink, and in a small neat hand, very different from the captain’s shaky handwriting, were these words: Most of the treasure here.\n\nOver on the back the same hand had written this:\n\n“Tall tree, Spyglass shoulder, bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E.\n\n“Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.\n\n“Ten feet."

Doctor Livesey had to go to London for another doctor to take his place; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the squire’s under the care of old Redruth. I was full of thoughts of the sea and the most charming dreams of strange islands and adventures. I thought by the hour about the map, all of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper’s room, I sailed to that island in my dreams, from every possible direction. I explored every acre of its surface. I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spyglass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing scenes. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought; sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us. But in all my dreams nothing happened to me so strange and awful as our actual adventures.\n\nSo the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, “To be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.” Obeying this order I found the following important news:\n\n“Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17—"

The squire has been talking, after all.”\n\n“Well, who’s a better right?” growled Redruth. “A queer thing if squire ain’t to talk because of Dr. Livesey, I should think.”\n\nAt that I said no more, and read straight on:\n\n“Blandly himself found the Hispaniola, and got her cheap. There is a class of men in Bristol who are against Blandly. They are saying that this honest creature would do anything for money, that the Hispaniola belonged to him, and that he sold it to me at much too high a price—but these things are false. None of them dare, however, to deny that the ship is excellent.\n\n“So far everything is going along well. The workmen, to be sure were slow; but time cured that. It was the crew that troubled me."

At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with rings in his ears. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain.\n\nThe captain was a sharp-looking man, who seemed angry with everything on board, and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us.\n\n“Captain Smollett, sir, asking to speak with you,” said he.\n\n“I am always at the captain’s orders. Show him in,” said the squire.\n\nThe captain, who was close behind, entered at once and shut the door behind him.\n\n“Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope. Everything in good shape?”\n\n“Well, sir,” said the captain, “I’d better speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offense. I don’t like this cruise; I don’t like the men; and I don’t like Mr. Arrow. That’s short and sweet.”\n\n“Perhaps, sir, you don’t like the ship?” inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see.\n\n“I can’t speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,” said the captain. “She seems a clever vessel; more I can’t say.”"

The ship proved to be a good one, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business.

He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it; for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, and other signs that he had been drinking. Time after time he was ordered to go below in shame.

Job Anderson was the next best man aboard, and he was chosen to serve as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather.

Old Pew, as had lost his sight, spent his 1,200 pounds in a year. Where is he now? Well, he’s dead now and buried. But for two years before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers! All because he didn’t save his money.”\n\n“Well, it ain’t much use, after all,” said the young seaman.\n\n“ ’Tain’t much use for fools, you may lay to it—that, nor nothing,” cried Silver. “But now, look here. You’re young, you are, but you’re as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I’ll talk to you like a man.”"

Slipping in an instant outside my barrel, I dived behind the foresail and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the bow.\n\nAll hands were already there. The fog had lifted almost at the same moment the moon rose. Away to the southwest of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and cone-shaped.\n\nSo much I saw almost in a dream, for I had not yet got over my horrid fear of a minute or two before. Then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett giving orders.

Although there was now no breeze, we had made a great deal of way during the night, and were now standing out about half a mile to the southeast of the low eastern coast. Gray woods covered a large part of the surface. This even color was broken up by streaks of yellow sand in the lower lands, and by many tall pine trees, taller than the rest of the woods—some alone, some in groups. The hills ran up clear above the trees in points of bare rock. All were strangely formed. The Spyglass, which was the tallest on the island, was the strangest in shape, running up steeply from almost every side, and then suddenly cut off at the top like a table.\n\nThe Hispaniola was rolling in the ocean swell. The whole ship was creaking, groaning, and jumping. I had to cling tight to the rope, and the world turned around before my eyes. For though I was a good enough sailor when the ship was under way, this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand, above all in the morning before breakfast."

But my heart sank into my boots, and ever after that first look, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island.\n\nWe had a hard morning’s work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship worked along three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the harbor behind Skeleton Island. I got into one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was great and the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as loud as the worst.\n\n“Well,” he said, with an oath, “It’s not for ever.”\n\nI thought this was a very bad sign; for, up to that day, the men had gone quickly and willing about their business."

The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods; but in less than a minute they were down again, and all was once more silent.\n\nThe land on all sides of us was covered with woods, the trees coming right down to the water’s edge. The shores were mostly flat, and the hilltops stood round at a distance in a sort of half circle, one here, one there. Two little rivers, or rather, two swamps, emptied out into the harbor. From the ship we could see nothing of the fort, for it was hidden among trees. If it had not been for the chart, we might have thought ourselves the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas.\n\nThere was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the sea booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside. A queer foul smell hung over the harbor—a smell of water-soaked leaves and rotting tree trunks. I noticed the doctor sniffing and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg."

Mutiny, it was plain, hung over us like a thundercloud.\n\nAnd it was not only we of the cabin party who saw the danger. Long John was hard at work going from group to group giving good advice, and no man could have shown a better example. He obeyed eagerly and with courtesy, and he was all smiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch in an instant, with the most cheerful “Ay, ay, sir!” in the world; and when there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as if to hide the discontent of the rest.\n\nOf all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this anxiety on the part of Long John seemed to be the worst.\n\nWe gathered in the cabin to talk things over."

Six fellows were to stay on board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to get into the gigs."

If six men were left by Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and since only six were left it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my help. I decided at once to go ashore. In a second I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she pushed off.\n\nNo one took notice of me, only the front man saying, “Is that you, Jim? Keep your head down.” But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me. From that moment I began to regret what I had done.\n\nThe crews raced for the beach. But the boat I was in, having a good start, and being at once the lighter and rowed by the best men, shot far ahead of the other, and the bow soon struck the shore among the trees. I caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest bushes, while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.\n\n“Jim, Jim!” I heard him shouting.\n\nBut you may be sure I paid no heed. Jumping, ducking and breaking through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer."

I now came out upon the edge of an open piece of rolling, sandy country about a mile long, dotted with a few pines and a great number of twisted trees, like the oak in growth, but with pale leaves like willows. On the far side of the open space stood one of the hills, with two peaks shining brightly in the sun.\n\nI now felt for the first time the joy of exploring. No people lived on the island. I had left my shipmates behind, and nothing lived in front of me but animals and birds. I ran about among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants, strange to me. Here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a rock and made a noise like the spinning of a top. Little did I dream that he was a deadly enemy, and that the noise was the famous rattle."

A wild duck flew up with a cry, another followed, and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air. I knew at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the edge of the swamp. Nor was I wrong. For soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I listened, grew steadily louder and nearer.\n\nThis put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest oak and hid there, as quiet as a mouse.\n\nAnother voice answered; and then the first voice, which I now knew to be Silver’s, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound they must have been talking earnestly and almost fiercely. But no single word came to my hearing."

I turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to return in the direction of the boats.\n\nInstantly the figure came out from behind the pine tree and, making a wide circle, began to head me off. I could see it was in vain for me to try to outrun this creature.

The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin. If there had been a breath of wind we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us and slipped away to sea. But there was no wind. And, to make it worse, down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and had gone ashore with the rest.\n\nOf course we did not doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed for his safety. With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again. We ran on deck. It was an exceedingly hot day. The smell of the place turned me sick. If ever a man smelt fever it was in that harbor. The six rascals were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forward part of the ship. Ashore we could see the gigs fastened, and a man sitting in each, near the place where the river runs in. One of them was whistling “Lillibullero.”\n\nWaiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with another small boat, the jolly-boat,* to see what could be learned."

If they had gone and told Silver, all might have been different. But they had their orders, I suppose, and sat quietly where they were and began again to whistle “Lillibullero.”\n\nThere was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it between us; and so, even before we landed we had lost sight of the gigs.

At the edge of the cleared space, they had built a fence six feet high, without door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labor, and too open to shelter any who might attack.

We might get him to join us.”\n\nI told my scheme to the captain, and between us we settled on the plans for carrying it out.\n\n“We put old Redruth to guard the gallery* between the cabin and the crew’s quarters forward, with three or four loaded guns. Hunter brought the boat round under the stern of the ship, and Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder, guns, bags of bread, barrels of pork, a small barrel of rum, and my medicine chest.\n\nIn the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett stayed on deck. The captain hailed Israel Hands, who was the most important man on board.\n\n“Mr. Hands,” he said, “here are two of us with a pair of pistols each. If any one of you six makes a sign of any kind, that man’s dead.”"

Joyce and I got out at the stern, and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.\n\nThis second trip alarmed the watchers along the shore. “Lillibullero” was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared.

In the first place, the little boat that we were in had been loaded too heavily. Five grown men, and three of them—Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain—over six feet high, was already more than she was meant to carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread bags. The boat was low in the water, and, before we had gone a hundred yards, my clothing was soaking wet.\n\nThe captain made us balance the boat, and we got her to lie a little more evenly on the water. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.\n\nIn the second place the tide was causing a rippling current which ran out toward the sea. Even the ripples were a danger to the loaded boat. But the worst of it was that we were swept out of our course and away from the proper landing place behind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.\n\n“I cannot keep her head for the fort, sir,” said I to the captain. I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars. “The tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?”"

You see, sir,” he went on, “if we do not, it’s hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs. Now, the way we are going, the current must let up, and then we can slip back along the shore.”\n\n“The current’s less already, sir,” said the man Gray. “You can ease her off a bit.”\n\n“Thank you, my man,” said I, quite as if nothing had happened. We had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.\n\nSuddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a little changed.\n\n“The gun!” said he.\n\n“I have thought of that,” said I, for I believed he was thinking that the pirates would try to land the big gun from the ship for an attack on the fort. “They could never get the gun ashore, and if they did, they could never haul it through the woods.”\n\n“Look back, doctor,” replied the captain."

By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that I could keep her steady for the shore. But the worst of it was that in doing so, our boat was brought around so that our broad side was toward the Hispaniola, and was as easy to hit as a barn door.\n\nI could hear, as well as see, that rum-faced rascal, Israel Hands, dropping the shot on the deck.\n\n“Who’s the best shot?” asked the captain.\n\n“Mr. Trelawney, far and away,” said I.\n\n“Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir?

The other three guns had gone down with the boat.\n\nTo add to our fear, we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore. There was great danger that we might be cut off from the fort. Besides, we were afraid that if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by a half a dozen, they might not have the sense to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce was a doubtful case—a pleasant, polite man, but not quite fitted for a man of war.\n\nWith all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and stores."

At the same time, seeing that Gray was not armed, I handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand, frown, and make the blade sing through the air. It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.\n\nForty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the fort in front of us.

Tired though we all were, two were sent out for wood for the fire; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth. The doctor was named cook; I was the watch at the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.\n\nFrom time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head. Whenever he did so, he had a word for me.\n\n“That man Smollett,” he said once, “is a better man than I am. And when I say that it means a good deal, Jim.”\n\nAnother time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his head on one side and looked at me.\n\n“Is this Ben Gunn a man?” he asked.\n\n“I do not know, sir,” said I. “I think he might be crazy.”"

You remember the little box I have, don’t you? Well, in that little box I carry a piece of cheese—a cheese made in Italy, very rich. Well, that’s for Ben Gunn!”\n\nBefore supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand, and stood round him for a while bareheaded in the breeze. A good deal of wood had been got in, but not enough to suit the captain. He shook his head over it and told us we “must get back to this tomorrow rather more lively.” Then, when we had eaten our pork, the three chiefs got together in a corner to talk things over."

But our best hope, they thought, was to kill off the pirates until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the Hispaniola. After the fight there were only 15 left of the 19; two others were wounded, and one at least—the man shot beside the gun—badly wounded, if he were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives with the greatest of care. And, besides that, we had two friends—rum and the climate.\n\nAs for the rum, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear the pirates roaring and singing late into the night. As for the climate, the doctor was certain that, camped where they were in the marsh, the half of them would be on their backs with fever before a week.\n\n“So,” he added, “if we are not all shot down first, they’ll be glad to leave in the Hispaniola. It’s always a ship, and they can sail away as pirates, I suppose.”\n\n“First ship that ever I lost,” said Captain Smollett.\n\nI was dead tired, as you may fancy.

The sky was bright and the tops of the trees shone in the sun. But where Silver stood with his man all was still in shadow, and they waded knee deep in a low white mist that had crawled during the night out of the swamp. The chill and the fog were proof that the island was damp, full of fever, and certainly not a healthful spot.\n\n“Keep inside, men,” said the captain. “Ten to one this is a trick.”\n\nThen he hailed Silver.\n\n“Who goes? Stand, or we fire.”\n\n“Flag of truce,” cried Silver.\n\nThe captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way if a shot should be fired. He turned and spoke to us.\n\n“Doctor, put your guards at their posts. Dr. Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The others stand by to load the guns. Lively, men, and careful.”\n\nAnd then he turned again to the mutineers.\n\n“And what do you want with your flag of truce?” he cried.\n\nThis time it was the other man who replied.\n\n“Cap’n Silver, sir, to come inside and make a bargain,” he shouted."

These poor lads have chosen me cap’n after you left, sir. We’re willing to give up, if we can make a bargain, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap’n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here fort, and one minute to get out of shot before a gun is fired.”\n\n“My man,” said Captain Smollett, “I have not the least wish to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that’s all. If there are any tricks, they’ll be on your side, and the Lord help you.”\n\n“That’s enough, cap’n,” shouted Long John, cheerfully. “A word from you’s enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.”\n\nWe could see the man who carried the flag of truce trying to hold Silver back. But Silver laughed at him aloud, and slapped him on the back, as if the idea of fear were silly. Then he walked up to the fence, threw over his crutch, and with great strength and skill got himself over the fence and dropped safely to the other side."

He was whistling to himself, “Come, lasses and lads.”\n\nSilver had terrible hard work getting up the hill. What with the steep slope, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he and his crutch were almost helpless.

Hunter lived all day, breathing loudly like the old captain at home at the “Admiral Benbow.” But sometime in the following night he died, without sign or sound.\n\nAs for the captain, his wounds were bad indeed but not dangerous.

What I began to do was to envy the doctor, walking in the cool shadow of the woods, with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines; while I sat in the hot blockhouse, with so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around.\n\nAll the time I was washing out the blockhouse, and then washing up the things from dinner, this envy kept growing stronger and stronger. At last, being near a bread bag, and no one seeing me, I filled both pockets of my coat with bread.\n\nI was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish, bold act; but I made up my mind to do it as carefully as I possibly could. This bread, if anything should happen to me, would keep me from starving till far on in the next day.\n\nThe next thing I took was a pair of pistols, and as I already had powder and bullets, I was well supplied with arms."

Do as you pleased, she always moved to the side more than anything else, and turning round and round was what she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself said that she was “queer to handle till you knew her way.”\n\nCertainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the one I wished to go. The most part of the time we were going to one side, and I am very sure I never should have got to the ship at all except for the tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping me down; and there lay the Hispaniola right in the way, hardly to be missed.\n\nFirst she loomed before me like a patch of something yet blacker than darkness. Then she began to take shape. The next moment, as it seemed (for the further I went, the swifter grew the current of the tide), I was beside her and had seized in my hands the thick rope which held her to the anchor."

But I remembered that a tightly stretched rope, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to one, if I were so foolish as to cut the Hispaniola from her anchor, I and the boat would be knocked clean out of the water.\n\nThis brought me to a full stop, and if good luck had not come my way, I should have given up my plan. But the light breezes which had begun blowing from the southeast and south had swung round after night into the southwest. Just while I was thinking, a puff came, caught the Hispaniola, and forced her up against the current. To my great joy, I felt the rope loosen, and my hand dipped for a second under water.\n\nWith that I made up my mind, took out my knife, opened it with my teeth, and cut almost through the heavy rope, leaving just enough to hold the vessel.

The hill was bare and dark, with cliffs 40 or 50 feet high, and covered with great masses of fallen rock. I was not more than a quarter of a mile out to sea, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.\n\nThat notion was soon given up. Among the fallen rocks the great waves pounded and roared. I could see that if I tried to land, I should be dashed to death upon the rough shore.\n\nNor was that all. For crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with great splashes, I saw huge smooth monsters, dozens of them together, making the rocks echo with their barking.\n\nI now know that they were sea lions,* and entirely harmless.

As both the wind and the current were from the south, the waves were not rough but rose and fell smoothly.\n\nHad this not been the case, I should long ago have been drowned.

And you’ll please call me your captain.”\n\nHe looked at me darkly enough, but said nothing. Some of the color had come back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still slipped every time the ship rolled.\n\n“And,” I added, “I can’t have these colors, Mr. Hands; and, by your leave, I’ll strike them. Better none than the Jolly Roger.”\n\nAnd again dodging the mainsail, I ran to the color lines, pulled down the hated black flag of the pirates, and threw it into the sea.\n\n“God save the king!” said I, waving my cap. “And there’s an end to Captain Silver!”\n\nHe watched me closely, his chin all the while on his chest."

In three minutes I had the Hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island. We had good hopes of reaching the northern point before noon, and coming down again as far as North Inlet before high water. At high tide we could beach her safely, and wait till low tide to land.\n\nThen I went below to my own chest, where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother’s. With this, Hands bound up the great cut he had received in the leg. After he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the rum, he began to feel better, and looked almost as well as ever.\n\nWe sailed before the breeze like a bird, the coast of the island flashing by, and the view changing every minute. Soon we were past the high lands and beside low, sandy country, and soon we were beyond that again, and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north.\n\nI was quite happy with my new command, and pleased with the bright, sunny weather and these different views of the coast.

Only, as we had no power to anchor, and dared not beach her till the tide was high, we had some time to wait. Hands told me how to lay the ship to—that is, to head her directly into the wind and keep her there so that she stood still. After a good many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal.\n\n“Cap’n,” said he at last, with that same queer smile, “here’s my old shipmate, O’Brien. Suppose you was to toss him overboard. I don’t take no blame for killing him, but I don’t think he is a pretty sight now, do you?”\n\n“I’m not strong enough and I don’t like the job; and there he lies, for all of me,” said I.\n\n“This here is an unlucky ship—this Hispaniola, Jim,” he went on. “There’s a lot of men been killed in this ship—a lot of poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship in Bristol. I never seen such dirty luck, not I. There was this here O’Brien, now—he’s dead, ain’t he? Well now, I’ve never went to school, and you’re a lad as can read and figure.

They kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with a glance upon the dead O’Brien. All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty way, so that a child could have told that he was trying to trick me. I thought that it would be wise to keep the stupid fellow from knowing that I saw through his tricks.\n\n“Some wine?” I said. “Far better.

I knew he would not expect to see me there; yet I took great care not to be seen. And certainly the worst of my fears proved too true.\n\nHe was on his hands and knees; and, though his leg seemed to hurt him pretty badly when he moved, yet it was at a good fast rate that he trailed himself across the deck. In half a minute he reached over and picked, out of a pile of rope, a long knife, dark with dried blood. He looked at it for a moment, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily hiding it in his coat, hurried back into his old place again.\n\nThis was all that I needed to know.

I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, seized a bottle of wine, and now, with this in my hand, I came back on deck.\n\nHands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a heap and with his eyelids closed, as though he were too weak to bear the light. He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good drink, saying, “Here’s luck!” Then he lay quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a piece.\n\n“Cut me a piece of that,” said he, “for I haven’t no knife, and hardly strength enough, even if I had.

The entrance to this northern harbor was not only narrow and shallow, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be carefully handled to be got in. I obeyed Hands’s orders. I am very sure that he was a fine seaman; for we went around and around, and dodged in, just missing the banks.\n\nThe shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern harbor; but the space was long and narrow, and more like the mouth of a river. Right before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of decay. It had been a great vessel of three masts, but had lain so long that it was hung about with great strings of seaweed. On the deck, shore bushes had taken root, and now grew thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the harbor was calm.\n\n“Now,” said Hands, “look there. There’s a fine spot for to beach a ship in. Fine flat sand, never a breeze, trees all around it, and flowers blooming like a garden on that old ship.”\n\n“And once beached,” I inquired, “how shall we get her off again?”"

Instead I stood looking over the side of the ship, watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows. I might have died without a struggle for my life, had not a sudden fear seized me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I had heard a sound, or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye.

And I think this saved my life, for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, in his tracks.\n\nBefore he could begin again, I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped. Just in front of the mainmast, I stopped and drew a pistol from my pocket. I took a cool aim, though he had already turned and was once more coming straight after me, and drew the trigger. There was neither flash nor sound; the powder had been wet with sea water. I cursed myself for my neglect. Why had I not, long before, taken care of my pistols?

I placed my palms against the mainmast, which was of a good size, and waited, every nerve stretched.\n\nSeeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused. And a moment or two passed in dodging on his part, and the same movements upon mine. It was a game that I had often played at home on the rocks of Black Hill Cove. But never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as now. Still, as I say, it was a boy’s game, and I thought I could hold my own at it, against an old seaman with a wounded leg.

Sometimes, by the rippling of the water, he seemed to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. But he was dead enough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish in the very place where he had planned my death.\n\nI was no sooner sure of this than I began to feel sick, faint, and terrified. The hot blood was running over my back and chest. The knife, where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot iron.

In that position I could easily lift him over the side. I had now seen so much of death that I had lost almost all my terror for the dead. So I took him by the waist and, with one good swing, tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding plunge. The red cap came off, and remained floating on the surface.

The smaller jib sails I quickly lowered, and brought tumbling to the deck. But the mainsail was a harder matter. Of course, when the schooner turned over on her side, the mainsail had swung round and down, and a foot or two of the lower end of the sail now hung under water. I thought this made it still more dangerous. Yet the strain was so heavy that I was almost afraid to touch it.

The pirates held the house and stores. There was the barrel of rum, there were the pork and bread, as before; and, to my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only believe that all had died, and my heart grieved me that I had not been there to die with them.\n\nThere were six of the pirates, all told. Not another man was left alive. Five of them were on their feet in an instant. The sixth had only risen upon his elbow. He was deadly pale, and the blood-stained cloth round his head told that he had been wounded.\n\nThe parrot sat smoothing her feathers, on Long John’s shoulder. He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used to. He still wore the fine suit in which he had come to the fort, but it was much the worse for wear, torn and covered with clay.\n\n“So,” said he, “here’s Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers! Dropped in, eh? Well, I think that’s friendly.”\n\nAnd he sat down upon the rum barrel and began to fill a pipe."

You, gentlemen, you needn’t stand up for Mr. Hawkins. He’ll excuse you, you may lay to that. And so, Jim, here you are, and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when first I set my eyes on you, but this here is too much for me to understand.”\n\nTo all this I made no answer. They had set me with my back against the wall; and I stood there, looking Silver in the face, with black despair in my heart.\n\nSilver took a pull or two at his pipe with great calm, and then went on again."

I’ve always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit, and the picture of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always wanted you to join me and take your share and die a gentleman. Now, my lad, you’ve got to. Cap’n Smollett’s a fine seaman, as I’ll own up to any day, but too strict. ‘Duty is duty,’ says he, and right he is. Just you keep clear of the cap’n, for you ran away from your duty. The doctor himself is gone dead against you—’ungrateful scamp’ was what he said. The short and the long of the whole story is this here—you can’t go back to your own party, for they won’t have you. You’ll have to join with Cap’n Silver.”\n\nSo far so good. My friends, then, were still alive.\n\n“I’m all for talking things over,” said Silver. “If you like being with us, well, you’ll join. If you don’t, Jim, why, you’re free to answer no—free and welcome, shipmate. Nothing could be fairer than that, shiver my sides!”\n\n“Am I to answer, then?” I asked, with a trembling voice. Through all this talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that hung over me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast."

And then, in his first sweet tones, he said to me, “Yesterday morning, down came Dr. Livesey with a flag of truce. Says he, ‘Cap’n Silver, you’re sold out. Ship’s gone.’ Well, maybe we’d been taking a glass of rum and a song to help it round. I won’t say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone. I never seen a bunch of men look so foolish, and you may lay to that. ‘Well,’ says the doctor, ‘let’s bargain.’ We bargained, him and I, and here we are, stores, rum, blockhouse, and the wood you was thoughtful enough to cut. As for your friends, they’ve gone. I don’t know where they are.”\n\nHe drew again quietly at his pipe."

As for that boy, I don’t know where he is,’ says he, ‘nor I don’t much care! We’re about sick of him.’ These was his words.”\n\n“Is that all?” I asked.\n\n“Well, it’s all that you’re to hear, my son,” returned Silver.\n\n“And now I am to choose?”\n\n“And now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,” said Silver."

I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land. I heard you, John, and you Dick Johnson, and Israel Hands, who is now at the bottom of the sea, and I told every word you said.

But his eye kept wandering, and he kept the tail of it on his followers. They, on their part, drew gradually together toward the far end of the blockhouse, and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear like a stream. One after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces.

The coals of the great fire had so far burned themselves out, and there was so little light from it, that I understood why the pirates wanted a torch. About halfway down the slope to the fort, they were gathered in a group. One held the light. Another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching this man. I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand.

All a-doin’ well, your patients was—all well and merry.”\n\nSo he chattered on, standing on the hilltop, with his crutch under his elbow and one hand upon the side of the log house—quite the same old John in voice, manner, and word.\n\n“We’ve quite a surprise for you, too, sir,” he went on. “We’ve a little stranger here—he! He! A new boarder and roomer, sir, and looking fit as a fiddle. Slept, he did, right alongside of John—side by side we was, all night.”\n\nDr. Livesey was by this time across the fence and pretty near Silver. I could hear the change in his voice as he said:\n\n“Not Jim?”"

Let us look at these patients of yours.”\n\nA moment afterward he had entered the blockhouse, and, with one grim nod to me, went on with his work among the sick. He did not seem to be afraid, though he must have known that his life, among these evil men, was in constant danger. He rattled on to his patients as if he were paying a visit in a quiet English family. The men treated him as if nothing had happened—as if he were still ship’s doctor, and they still faithful hands before the mast.\n\n“You’re doing well, my friend,” he said to the fellow with the wounded head, “and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you. Your head must be as hard as iron. Well, George, how goes it? You’re a pretty color, certainly. Why, you must have a fever, man. Did you take that medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?”\n\n“Ay, ay, sir, he took it, sure enough,” returned Morgan."

You and me must stick close, back to back like, and we’ll save our necks in spite of everything.”\n\nJust then a man called to us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand with our bread and pork. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it had now grown so hot that they could scarcely go near it. They had cooked three times more than we could eat. One of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared again. I never in my life saw men so careless of the future.

If he had not struck a bargain with the doctor, he and his men would have had to live on what they could kill by hunting, and drink water from the streams of the island. All their food, of course, had been left on the Hispaniola. Water would have been little to their taste; a sailor is not usually a good shot.

From this spot, we could see a long way in either direction. Before us, over the treetops, we saw the Cape of the Woods. Behind we not only looked down upon the harbor and Skeleton Island, but saw—clear across the sand point—a great field of open sea to the east.

There was no sound but that of the distant sea and the hum of insects in the brush.\n\nSilver, as he sat, took readings from his compass.\n\n“There are three ‘tall trees,’” said he, “about in the right line from Skeleton Island. ‘Spyglass Shoulder,’ I take it, means that lower point there.

That ain’t in nature, surely?”\n\n“Well, that’s so,” George said. “You’ve a head upon your shoulders, John, and no mistake. And come to think of it, it was like Flint’s voice, all right, but not just exactly like it, after all. It was more like somebody else’s voice now—it was more like—”\n\n“By the powers, Ben Gunn!” roared Silver.\n\n“Ay, and so it were,” cried Morgan, springing on his knees. “Ben Gunn it were!”\n\n“It don’t make much difference, do it?” asked Dick. “Ben Gunn’s not here in the body, any more than Flint.”\n\n“Why nobody minds Ben Gunn,” cried Merry. “Dead or alive, nobody minds him.”"

He had said the truth; dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn.\n\nDick alone still held his Bible and looked around him as he went, with fearful glances. But he found no sympathy, and Silver even teased him for it.\n\n“I told you,” said he—“I told you, you had spoiled your Bible. If it ain’t no good any more, what do you suppose a spirit would care for it? Not that!” and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his crutch.\n\nBut Dick was still unhappy; indeed, it was soon plain to me that the lad was sick. The fever which Dr. Livesey had warned them about, was upon him.\n\nIt was fine open walking here. Our way lay a little downhill, for, as I have said, the land sloped toward the west.

Then he looked at me and nodded as much as to say, “Here is a tight spot,” as, indeed, I thought it was. His looks were now quite friendly. I was so disgusted at these quick changes that I whispered, “So you’ve changed sides again.”\n\nThere was no time left for him to answer. The pirates, with oaths and cries, began to leap, one after another, into the pit, and to dig with their fingers, throwing the boards aside as they did so. Morgan found a piece of gold.

Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been sent ahead to do his best alone. Then the idea had come to Ben to scare his former shipmates. He was so successful that Gray and the doctor had come up and were already hiding in the woods before the treasure hunters got there.\n\n“Ah,” said Silver, “it were lucky for me that I had Hawkins here. You would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given it a thought, Doctor.”\n\n“Not a thought,” replied Dr. Livesey, cheerfully.\n\nAnd by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick, broke up one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for North Inlet.\n\nThis was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was already very tired, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and we were soon gliding swiftly over a smooth sea.

A single guard on the shoulder of the hill was enough to protect us and we thought, besides, they had had more than enough of fighting.\n\nTherefore, the work was pushed on rapidly.

Two of the bars of gold made a good load for a grown man—one that he was glad to walk slowly with. For my part, as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave, packing the money into bread bags.\n\nIt was a strange collection, like that in Billy Bones’s sea chest, but so much larger and with so many more different kinds of coins. There were English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese coins. There were strange pieces from the East, covered with queer marks, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces with a hole through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck.
