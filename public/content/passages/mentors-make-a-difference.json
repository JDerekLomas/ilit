Teens, especially, often need guidance and support from others.\n\nYou may have lots of talent and energy. Your friends may support you. Still, at some point, you are probably going to need the wisdom of someone from an older generation. An adult who has been where you are now can guide you, inspire you, and give you the push you need to succeed."

Hollywood has long recognized our appreciation of inspirational teachers. Popular movies such as Stand and Deliver and Freedom Writers are based on the stories of real-life teachers. These teachers taught kids as much about life as they did about writing and math. In Stand and Deliver, a teacher motivates a class full of East Los Angeles barrio kids to care enough about mathematics to pass an Advanced Placement Calculus Test. In Freedom Writers, a teacher turns around the lives of troubled kids at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California."

They spend time with kids, sharing interests and cheering the kids' successes. Whole communities can also be mentors. They can sponsor programs to help young people succeed in life. In Boston, teens learn about organic farming by working with adult farmers in community gardens. The food they grow goes to food banks and soup kitchens."
